"""Which platforms the Rust build can actually get its native libraries on.

A Mac tester found the port unbuildable for two reasons that no test would
have caught: `tools/fetch_bass.py` bailed out on anything but Windows, so
there was no BASS to load, and the `sdl2` crate linked with a bare `-lSDL2`
that never looks in Homebrew's prefix, so the link failed with SDL2 sitting
right there. Both are build configuration rather than gameplay, and both are
invisible from a Windows machine -- which is exactly why they are pinned
here rather than left to whoever next opens a Mac.
