    This assertion has been through three shapes. It began as `lfs: true` on

    A full fetch on both matrix runners on every push then spent about half a
    gigabyte of LFS bandwidth per commit, which exhausted the repository's
    budget and turned every run red at checkout, before a single test ran
    (2026-08-23); the job dropped to fetching sounds.pak alone. Once the
    budget was gone outright that fetch returned a pointer too, and the tests
    skipped themselves -- green, having checked nothing.
