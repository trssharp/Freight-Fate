        """Driving event announcements (hazards, warnings, weather, ...).

        ``valid``, when given, is a zero-argument callable answering "is this
        line still true?" -- consulted if the line is cut mid-sentence and
        offered a rescue. A line whose moment has passed (the scale is behind
        the truck, the damage total has moved on) is dropped instead of
        replayed verbatim; message review holds the words either way.

        With the dedicated SAPI event voice enabled, events speak on their own
        channel, where ``interrupt`` only cuts off a previous event -- so an
        urgent cue can still jump ahead of a stale one without touching the
        screen reader.

        With it disabled the player has chosen to hear events through their
        screen reader. Urgent events first flush stale game speech, then speak
        as a fresh queued utterance so old messages do not bury the warning.

        Every line first passes the pacer, which knows what the player has
        already heard. A line identical to one spoken a moment ago is dropped
        outright -- one moment noticed on several frames is still one moment.
        ``key`` marks a standing condition (a damaged load, an engine at
        redline) rather than an event: it speaks when it starts and again only
        when what it says has changed. ``force`` is for a line the player
        asked for and must hear whether or not it repeats.

        Queued events then ride an anti-backlog projection either way: a line
        that would start speaking well after the moment it described flushes
        the expired backlog and speaks now instead of joining the recital.
        ``priority`` sets how long it is willing to wait first -- route
        announcements (the planned stop, the exit) give ambient chatter well
        under a second before going in front of it.

        An interrupting line's purge also lands on whatever the voice was
        mid-way through. When that was a ROUTE or CRITICAL line still
        plausibly speaking, the pacer hands it back and it is resubmitted
        queued, right behind the interrupting line -- safety line first,
        then the line it stepped on, never dropped.

        ``review`` keeps a line out of the reviewable message log. An assist
        that interrupts to say it is acting would otherwise land exactly where
        the warning it cut off should be, so the review keys that exist to
        rescue an interrupted line would hand back the interruption instead.

        ``text`` may be a :class:`SpokenMessage` normal/terse pair; the
        player's speech mode picks the rendering here, so terse coverage is
        a property of the message definition rather than of the call site.
        A pair whose terse rendering is empty is dropped whole in terse
        mode: not spoken, not logged, exactly like a muted chatter line.

        were not -- the confirmation note came out about 4 dB LOUDER than the
        chime it replaced, and a trooper pass never drops below its old level.
        Both measurements missed the point, because a listener hears a level

        A spoken line ducks engine, weather and radio to SPEECH_DUCK_LEVEL
        while it talks. A silenced line returns from ``say_event`` before
        reaching that duck, so its earcon played against the full road bed --
        roughly 6 dB worse off than the words it stands in for, and quiet is
