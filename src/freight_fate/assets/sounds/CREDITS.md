# Sound and Music Credits

Sound effects in this directory come from a few sources, documented per file in
the tables below: original effects created for Freight Fate (no third-party
recordings or samples), weather and road loops produced with ElevenLabs sound
effects tooling, and driving sounds cut from
commercially licensed sample libraries (see "Licensed Driving Sounds" below).
A number of in-cab cues were shared by Darren Duff early in the project; he
holds no license for that material (owner ruling 2026-07-22), so every Duff
row below is scheduled for replacement, not attribution -- most are already
superseded by the Career 1.9 sound pack. The main menu, Open
Road, and Night Haul themes are Suno remakes created by the project owner. The July 2026 radio-station batch
(fifty-two tracks marked "2026-07 Zero batch" below) was composed with Suno V5
through the
Zero capability marketplace, with original lyrics written for Freight Fate;
those tracks are subject to the applicable Suno terms for the generating
account.

The default sound_lib weather loops were generated for Freight Fate with
ElevenLabs sound effects tooling, then reviewed and selected for the in-cab
weather mix.

The original project sound effects, and the ElevenLabs-generated assets
(original project assets subject to the applicable ElevenLabs terms for the
generating account), are part of Freight Fate and covered by the project's
PolyForm Noncommercial License (see `LICENSE` at the repository root): free to
use and share for noncommercial purposes, all other rights reserved by the
project owner. They are not dedicated to the public domain.

The in-cab truck sounds used for selected vehicle cues are authorized sounds
that [Darren Duff](https://darrenduff.com/) found, liked, and sent along for the
project. Darren also shared the louder/doubled-volume versions used for the
current idle, start, and shutdown cues.

| Liquid surge, tank trailer | `vehicle/liquid_wash.wav`, `vehicle/liquid_hit.wav`, `vehicle/liquid_hit_lateral.wav` | Original synthesized tank-surge layer (deterministic seeded spectral-domain DSP, `sound-test/liquid_surge.py`): a wash bed held only while the liquid is running, plus the arrival slap through the shell's modal ring, fore-aft and lateral distinguished by ring. Banded 1.5-4 kHz on purpose -- the engine and road beds own everything below a kilohertz and the jake runs at full gain during exactly the deceleration that produces surge |

## Radio Hosts And Static

The 2026-08-14 station-identity batch gave all 19 in-game stations a real
host, three station IDs (two sung jingles and a spoken legal ID), and a
shared pool of fictional ads. Every host line, ad read, and legal-ID script
is original writing for Freight Fate; no real station, host, or business is
represented.
