//! Packed sound assets for frozen builds.
//!
//! Release builds ship the `assets/sounds` tree as two masked pack files
//! instead of a browsable folder: `freight_fate/music.pak` carries every entry
//! under `music/`, `freight_fate/sounds.pak` carries everything else. The
//! split keeps the small (tens-of-MB) gameplay SFX library out of the much
//! larger (several-hundred-MB) music payload, so an LFS pull for a sound-only
//! change does not drag the whole music library with it. Each pack is a
//! deflated zip XOR-masked with a fixed key, so renaming one does not turn it
//! back into an openable archive; this deters casual editing, nothing more.
//! Career 1.9 source checkouts receive the encrypted packs through Git LFS.
//! Tests can explicitly disable the default packs and exercise the loose-file
//! fallback.
//!
//! `tools/pack_sounds.py` writes both packs; the audio engine reads them
//! through [`open_default`], which returns one object that routes a lookup to
//! whichever pack carries that name -- callers do not need to know the packs
//! are split. The pack payload is deterministic for identical inputs.
//!
//! Port of `freight_fate/assets_pack.py`. This file also hosts the
//! process-global registry of runtime-synthesized sounds
//! (`audio.register_generated_sound` in Python) -- see the
//! [generated sounds](#generated-sounds) section -- because the asset lookup
//! consults it before either pack.
