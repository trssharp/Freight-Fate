//! rows (interchange and ramp arcs) are excluded here: ramps carry their own
//! speech and the future curve-nav layer owns them.
//!
//! Which rows those are is READ from OSM at bake time, not guessed at here:
//! `tools/bake_curve_connectors.py` sets `connector` from the road class

//!
//! Severity bands come from the advisory speed the bake computed at 0.3 g
//! lateral -- the same number a posted yellow diamond would show -- EXCEPT the
//! hairpin, which is a shape rather than a speed and is decided by deflection
//! alone (see `HAIRPIN_DEFLECTION_DEG`).
//!
//! Interstate mainline records are screened for sweep artifacts on the way in
//! (see `INTERSTATE_MIN_RADIUS_FT`); the raw bake keeps every row.
//!
//! US and state routes get a second, narrower screen: sweep artifacts also
//! land on non-interstate mainline (the same city-departure kink that hits an
//! interstate can ride the US-route out of the same city), but road class
//! alone cannot tell those apart from a real switchback -- US-550 and the Salt
//! River Canyon really are that sharp. `curve_artifacts.jsonl`
//! (`tools/screen_curve_artifacts.py`) names the specific `(leg, seq)`
//! records an offline check flagged: flat local ground where no real hairpin
//! can exist, city-departure geometry at a leg's ends off the mountains, and a
//! radius no through highway of any class can bend to. Everything else, sharp
//! or not, is left alone -- nothing in mountain terrain is ever flagged.
//!
//! A third screen applies to mainline of every class and asks only whether a
//! record agrees with itself: a bend's recorded span has to be able to hold
//! the arc its own radius and deflection describe, and opposite-direction
//! curves cannot meet with no straight between them. Terrain cannot excuse
//! either, so unlike the two above, this one does look at mountain roads --
//! which is where it was found (`ARC_CONSISTENCY_MIN`).
