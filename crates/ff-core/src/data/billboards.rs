//! Roadside billboard content -- the spoken flavor you pass on the
//! interstate (port of `freight_fate/data/billboards.py`).
//!
//! THIS SIDE DELIBERATELY LEADS THE PYTHON as of 2026-08-24. The port was a
//! line-for-line copy until a tester reported Oklahoma billboards being read
//! in Tennessee; the anchoring below is the fix, and the Python original still
//! has the shield-only lookup that caused it. The copy itself is unchanged in
//! both -- what moved is where each line is allowed to be read, plus two lines
//! evicted from the anywhere pool for naming places. Anyone reconciling the
//! two should port the anchors FORWARD, not strip them back.
//!
//! Billboards are ambient roadside color: short, funny, occasionally corridor-
//! specific signs the event voice reads on the low-priority ambient tier
//! (safety callouts always preempt them). This is the CONTENT layer -- the
//! sign copy, authored as data so it stays the map/content author's lane and
//! unit-tests with no audio. The placement/scheduling that actually speaks
//! them (riding the navigation-cue and ambient-chatter machinery) is
//! gameplay-layer follow-on.
//!
//! Two placement modes the content is written for:
//!
//! * ANYWHERE -- the corridor-agnostic pools (generic Americana, attorney ads,
//!   church signs, roadside oddities), drawn from a seeded per-trip RNG so a
//!   drive is deterministic and offline. THE ONLY THING THAT MAY GO IN THESE
//!   POOLS is a line that would be true beside any road in the country: an
//!   invented diner, a joke about the road, an adult superstore that names no
//!   town. A line naming a real town, region, exit, attraction, or a regional
//!   chain belongs to a corridor or a state-gated genre pool, not here.
//! * PLACED -- `CORRIDOR_BILLBOARDS` maps an interstate shield to signs for
//!   the real roadside culture of that route, so a South Dakota Interstate 90
//!   run passes the "free ice water, three hundred miles to go" genre and a
//!   Mojave Interstate 15 run passes alien jerky.
//!
//! A shield alone is not a place. Interstate 40 runs through Oklahoma AND
//! Tennessee, so keying only on the shield read Okemah and Muskogee to drivers
//! outside Knoxville -- a billboard is one of the few things telling a driver
//! who cannot see the road where they are, and a misplaced one is the game
//! asserting something untrue about the truck's position. So every corridor
//! line carries a `SignAnchor` saying where its copy is true, and the placer
//! refuses it anywhere else.
//!
//! Real roadside attractions are named the way real truck-stop brands already
//! are (nominative -- a driver really does pass Wall Drug on Interstate 90).
//! The sign COPY is original parody, not lifted ad text; how closely to echo
//! a real slogan is an owner call, like the radio-licensing and Big Buck's
//! decisions.
//!
//! Player-facing speech: no codes, no map tags, and numbers spelled in words
//! so a screen reader never reads a bare figure ("nine ninety-nine", not
//! "9.99").
//!
//! The 2026-08-12 owner batch (see the pools tagged with that date) is the one
//! deliberate exception: those lines are final tester-round copy the owner
//! asked to ship verbatim, numerals included ("$4.89/gallon", "37 miles", "6
//! spaces", "3rd"/"#2", "362 days"). The billboards tests carry a matching,
//! explicit allow-list for exactly those lines -- the digit-free rule still
//! applies to everything else, including any future addition to these same
//! pools.
//!
//! SONG TRIBUTES (2026-08-12): every achievement in achievements.py credits a
//! song, and the highway pays some of them back. Tribute signs name the artist
//! and the song title only -- never a lyric, never a quoted line -- and read
//! as home-turf pride, not advertising. A tribute that names a place lives in
//! `CORRIDOR_BILLBOARDS` under that shield with an anchor; only the ones whose
//! whole point is being from everywhere at once live in
//! `SONG_TRIBUTE_BILLBOARDS`, which the random picker reaches for about one
//! draw in ten (`TRIBUTE_DRAW_CHANCE`) so the roadside stays attorneys,
//! fireworks, and pie, with a tribute as an occasional treat rather than a
//! museum wall.
