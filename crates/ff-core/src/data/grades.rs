//! Load-time screen for elevation artifacts in the baked grade data (port of
//! `freight_fate/data/grades.py`).
//!
//! Almost all of the world's 144,431 grade segments come from one place -- an
//! OpenRouteService route elevation profile over SRTM, segmented by terrain --
//! and some of them describe a slope no road of their class and terrain can
//! hold. The tell is the same one the curve sweep left behind: the extremes
//! sit on 0.2 and 0.3 mile spans, which is the length of a bridge or an
//! overpass, and a profile crossing a structure reads the deck rather than the
//! road under it.
//!
//! 1,106 segments no longer come from that profile. On 2026-09-19 every span
//! this screen clamped was read a second time against USGS 3DEP, and where
//! 3DEP returned a slope the road class could hold, the segment was re-sourced
//! to the measurement and says so in its own `source`
//! (`tools/screen_grades_3dep.py`). That took the world from 455 segments over
//! 8 percent to 141, and the count this screen still clamps from 1,271 to 242.
//!
//! What the re-read did NOT do is make this screen unnecessary, and the reason
//! is worth keeping: 165 of those spans came back with 3DEP CONFIRMING the
//! profile at 10 to 13 percent on roads that cannot hold it -- I-79 in West
//! Virginia at -13.4, for one. Two elevation models agree there because both
//! read ground, and the road is on a bridge above it. A second elevation
//! source cannot see that. The class ceiling is the only thing that does,
//! which is why those 165 were left for this screen rather than written into
//! the bake.
//!
//! WHY THIS SCREEN CANNOT COPY `curves` AND EXEMPT THE MOUNTAINS. There,
//! mountain terrain is never flagged, because a real switchback lives there.
//! Here the worst record left after the 3DEP re-read -- I-68 at 14.0 between
//! Morgantown and Cumberland -- sits on a leg labelled `mountain`, and the
//! label is coarse enough (3,098 segments carry it) that exempting it would
//! shelter most of the interstate artifacts. Road class
//! replaces terrain as the discriminator because it carries a harder fact: the
//! interstate system is designed to a 6 percent maximum, and the famously
//! brutal exceptions -- I-70 west of Denver, I-17 out of Phoenix, I-80 over
//! Donner -- sit at 6 to 7. There is no 12 percent interstate. US and state
//! routes really do climb harder (US-550 over Red Mountain Pass, CA-299
//! through the Trinity Alps), so their ceilings are set well above anything
//! real and only catch the frankly impossible.
//!
//! WHY THIS ONE CLAMPS WHERE `curves` DROPS. Curves are discrete events and a
//! dropped one is simply never announced. Grades tile the leg continuously,
//! and `Trip.grade_at` falls through to a synthesized terrain average for any
//! mile no segment covers -- so dropping a spike out of the middle of a real
//! climb would replace a measured-but-noisy reading with an invented one.
//! Clamping keeps the sign, keeps the climb, and caps the physics at what the
//! road can actually hold.
//!
//! The bake is never edited (see the provenance rule in `CLAUDE.md`). A
//! clamped segment records the adjustment in its own `source`, so a later
//! reader can see that this value was derived here rather than read from the
//! profile.
//!
//! WHERE THE CLAMP IS STILL WRONG: LEVEL GROUND. An agent drive on 2026-09-01
//! heard "Current grade 6.0 percent downhill" at the Chicago Cross-Dock gate.
//! Every leg into Chicago ends on the same artifact: the profile's last sample
//! sits at 800 feet on ground the rest of the leg reads at 584 to 610, because
//! SRTM is a SURFACE model and the city node is in the Loop, so the final 0.4
//! mile "climbs" 216 feet onto the skyline (+8.6 percent). The screen caught
//! it and capped it at the flat ceiling -- and a 6 percent hill in Chicago is
//! still a 6 percent hill in Chicago. The clamp exists to keep a real climb
//! under a noisy spike, and level ground has no climb to keep: FHWA's HPMS
//! Field Manual defines level terrain as ground that "permits heavy vehicles
//! to maintain approximately the same speed as passenger cars" and "generally
//! includes short grades of no more than 1 to 2 percent", and the AASHTO Green
//! Book caps freeway design grades on level terrain at 3 to 4 percent (Table
//! 8-1, Maximum Grades for Rural and Urban Freeways). So where BOTH the HPMS
//! class (read from FHWA) and the profile's own terrain label call the ground
//! level, a segment past the ceiling is not a road grade under noise -- it is
//! the structure or building the surface model read -- and it is REJECTED:
//! set to level, with a source note that says the value is assumed. Where the
//! two sources disagree (bake label `mountain`, HPMS `level`: Wolf Creek Pass,
//! the I-5 grades at Grants Pass -- HPMS's class is the modal one over a
//! leg's bounding box, and a long leg through a range can read level) the
//! terrain is uncertain and the clamp stays, so no real climb is flattened.
