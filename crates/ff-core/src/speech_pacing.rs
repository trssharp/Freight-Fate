//! Pacing, repeat suppression, and priority for the driving event voice.
//!
//! The event channel is a queue the game cannot inspect: it hands lines to a
//! voice that speaks them in submission order, and nothing in Prism will say
//! what is still waiting. Three things go wrong when the road talks straight
//! into it, all three reported from the same tester transcript (2026-08-11):
//!
//! * **The same moment said several times.** A code path that notices
//!   something runs every frame, so one sideswipe arrives as three identical
//!   lines inside half a second.
//! * **A standing condition read out forever.** A damaged load, an engine
//!   held at redline -- the truck is still in that state, so the warning
//!   fires again every few seconds for the rest of the drive. The player
//!   needs it when it starts and again when it gets worse, not on a loop.
//! * **The line that mattered buried.** The stop the player planned waits
//!   behind weather, tolls, and traffic chatter, and is still waiting when
//!   the exit has gone by.
//!
//! [`EventSpeechPacer`] answers all three from one place.
//!
//! Its original job -- and still its core -- is the backlog projection: each
//! submitted line extends a projected clear time by its estimated speaking
//! duration, so the game knows roughly when the voice falls silent. A queued
//! line that would START speaking more than its priority's budget after the
//! moment it described is by definition stale, and the caller delivers it
//! interrupting instead, which purges the dead backlog. Interrupting lines
//! reset the projection to truth, so estimate drift never outlives one
//! backlog.
//!
//! On top of that it remembers what the player has already heard (so a
//! repeat inside `REPEAT_WINDOW_S` never reaches the voice twice), what each
//! standing condition last said (so it speaks again only when it has
//! something new to say), and how long a line of each priority is willing to
//! wait -- a route announcement waits a moment behind chatter and then goes
//! ahead of it.
//!
//! The purge that delivers an interrupting line cuts both ways: it flushes
//! dead chatter, but it also lands on whatever the voice was mid-way through
//! -- and when that was a ROUTE or CRITICAL line (the weigh station notice,
//! the planned stop), the player lost an instruction, not colour (a tester
//! blew a weigh station this way, 2026-08-12). The pacer therefore keeps the
//! newest such line alongside its projected finish time, and an interrupt
//! arriving before that moment hands the line back to the caller to queue
//! right behind the interrupting one: safety line first, then the line it
//! stepped on. Only when the cut landed EARLY, though: a line the player had
//! mostly heard is dropped rather than said again whole, because a repeat
//! from the top reads as a stutter ("Start on West 14th Avenue" twice, a
//! whole state-crossing welcome twice in a tester's log, 2026-09-01). See
//! `MOSTLY_HEARD_FRACTION`.
//!
//! Durations are estimated from text length at a conservative default-voice
//! speaking rate. A faster voice just flushes a little less eagerly than it
//! could; a slower one flushes a little late but stays bounded -- either way
//! the player never again waits through a paragraph of expired narration.
//!
//! Port of `freight_fate/speech_pacing.py`.
