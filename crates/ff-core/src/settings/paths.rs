//! Where the game keeps its saves and settings.
//!
//! Port of `data_dir`, `_save_root`, `game_root` and their helpers from
//! `freight_fate/models/profile.py`. Settings needs them before the profile
//! model lands, and the profile port is expected to build on these (adding
//! the one-time legacy-save migration `data_dir` ran there, which is not
//! reproduced here).
//!
//! On Windows and Linux, Freight Fate is portable: profiles and settings
//! live in a `saves` directory inside the game's own main directory -- next
//! to the executable in a packaged build, the project root when running from
//! source.
//!
//! macOS apps live in `/Applications` and must not write beside themselves
//! (that folder is admin-owned and often read-only), so on macOS saves go in
//! the standard per-user `~/Library/Application Support/FreightFate` folder.
//!
//! The same reasoning covers Windows and Linux when the game itself sits in
//! a read-only location (for example Windows `Program Files`): if the
//! `saves` folder beside the game cannot be written, saves fall back to that
//! per-user data directory instead of failing on the first write and
//! crashing mid-session.
//!
//! Override the location with the `FREIGHT_FATE_DATA_DIR` environment
//! variable (which the tests use).

// * Process-wide (`AtomicBool`) on purpose, so a spawned worker refuses
//   exactly as the game loop would allow. That is the case a per-thread flag
//   could not reach and the reason this seam exists at all.
// * Without it, [`data_dir`] records the path in [`refused_save_dirs`] and
//   panics naming it. A quiet fallback to a temporary folder would read as a
//   fresh career -- a state the game handles perfectly gracefully and nobody
//   would ever look at.
