// only. Volvo publishes the same ladder as amber alert, torque limitation,
// 5 mph derate, idle only.
//
// The last rung is not the engine's decision at all, it is the law's. Under
// the CVSA North American Standard Out-of-Service Criteria a commercial
// vehicle carrying a qualifying defect is an imminent hazard and is
// prohibited from operating until it is repaired -- an inspector places it
// out of service at the roadside and it does not drive away. Brakes are the
// leading cause and carry an automatic trigger at 20 percent of the service
// brakes defective, which is the useful calibration here: losing a fifth of
// one safety system is already the wall, so a truck that has consumed nine
// tenths of its whole condition is far past any single out-of-service line.
// That is why the wall sits at DAMAGE_OUT_OF_SERVICE_PCT and not at 100:

// Both thresholds are the securement standard rather than round numbers. Under

// freight tied down to spec is not hurt by stopping hard, however alarming the
// stop. It is hurt by the sideways case, because the same regulation asks less
// there and a loaded van starts lifting a wheel around 0.35 g anyway.
//
// So: braking bites only past what a full service application can produce,
// which leaves the emergency application, a grade adding its own g to the

//
// Provenance: all three figures are ASSUMED. Engine makers do not publish
// rotating inertia; 3 kg m^2 is the order of a heavy-duty inline-six with
// its flywheel and clutch pack. Motoring drag of 12 percent of rated torque
// and rev-match fueling at 35 percent of the curve give a 500 rpm downshift
// blip in about 0.3 s and an upshift fall in about 0.15 s, the durations
