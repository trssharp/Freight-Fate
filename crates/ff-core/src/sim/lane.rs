// pushed the offset straight over and the driver held the opposite key against
// it, which meant the wheel that tracks a left-hand bend was the RIGHT one.
// Nobody noticed while the guide only reported drift, and it became untenable
// the moment the engine started leaning the way the road turns -- following
// that cue steered the truck off the road, which is how it was found (owner's
// drive on AZ-260, 100 percent cargo damage in one bend).
