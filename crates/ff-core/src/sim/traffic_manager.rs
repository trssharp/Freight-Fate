//! Small NPC traffic bubble around the player's truck (port of
//! `freight_fate/sim/traffic_manager.py`).
//!
//! The bubble is a window that travels with the truck. Vehicles are created
//! as the road reaches them and retired behind, which bounds the population
//! by the road around the player instead of by route length, and leaves
//! room for somebody coming up from behind and going past. Every draw is
//! keyed on the route and the seed so the same trip replayed puts the same
//! vehicle in the same place.
