//! The cross bubble: real NPC traffic on the road a ramp terminal meets.
//!
//! The mainline traffic bubble rotated ninety degrees (owner design,
//! 2026-08-20 -- "make passing traffic actually pass; this is why they're
//! NPCs"). When a terminal announces, a short simulated stretch of crossroad
//! comes to life around the conflict point: vehicles spawn at the edges with
//! seeded Poisson arrivals, drive through, and despawn on the far side. They
//! are entities, not audio sweeps -- they platoon behind slow leaders (the
//! real burst-then-gap rhythm no random stream produces), they queue for the
//! cross street's own signal phase, and their pan and loudness fall out of
//! simulated position, so finding a gap is a listening skill: exactly how a
//! sighted driver reads an intersection by looking left.
//!
//! Axis convention: position is MILES along the crossroad, negative on the
//! side the vehicle entered from, zero at the conflict point in front of the
//! player's stop bar. Vehicles all drive toward positive (each carries its
//! `from_side` so audio knows which ear it started in); left-entering and
//! right-entering streams are two independent lanes that do not interact,
//! which matches a two-way crossroad seen from the stop bar.
//!
//! Arrival rates are DESIGN CONSTANTS keyed to what the terminal already
//! knows -- its control kind and whether it is near a route city -- declared
//! as such below. The honest number would be the crossroad's own AADT, which
//! the bake does not carry yet; when it does (ROADMAP), the rates read from
//! it and these constants become the fallback.
//!
//! Port of `freight_fate/sim/cross_traffic.py`.
