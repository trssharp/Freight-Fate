//! Whether the officer at a post actually notices you, and what they noticed
//! (port of `freight_fate/sim/enforcement_observe.py`).
//!
//! Observation is a scored decision with five inputs a player can feel:
//! geometry (how close you are relative to the method's reach), line of
//! sight (a crest or hard bend blocks lidar; radar hardly cares), weather
//! (fog and heavy rain gut lidar and eyesight), traffic cover (running in a
//! pack at the pack's speed lowers the odds you are the one picked), and
//! severity (five over is noticed and ignored; twenty over is a certainty).
//! A post using its eyes also sees visible damage, missing chains, an unlit
//! truck at night, tailgating and lane misuse.
//!
//! Nothing here rolls a number. `observe` returns a confidence; the caller
//! makes the named, seeded, position-quantised draw against it.
