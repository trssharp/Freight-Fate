//! Trip simulation: progress along a route, grades, zones, stops, and events
//! (port of `freight_fate/sim/trip.py`).
//!
//! Python's `Trip` mixed in `TripRoadEventMixin`, `TripTrafficMixin` and
//! `EnforcementPostMixin`; here it is ONE struct defined in this file with
//! every field any of them touched, and `impl Trip` blocks in
//! `trip_road_events`, `trip_traffic` and `enforcement_posts` for the former
//! mixin methods. This file holds the struct, its construction and the clock;
//! the rest of `trip.py` is split by section into the `trip/` submodules
//! (`lookups`, `placement`, `place_time`, `zones`, `limits`, `streets`,
//! `update`).
