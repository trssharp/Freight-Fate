//! Real-world weather via the U.S. National Weather Service API
//! (https://api.weather.gov).
//!
//! The NWS API is a free, public government service that needs no API key (it
//! only asks for an identifying `User-Agent`). The provider resolves a city's
//! nearest observation station once, then fetches the latest observation in a
//! background thread and caches it, so the game loop never blocks on the network.
//! When a fetch fails or hasn't landed yet, callers get `None` and the simulated
//! weather carries on -- the game works identically offline.
//!
//! The NWS only covers the United States and its territories, which is exactly the
//! game's map. Each observation's free-text condition (e.g. "Mostly Cloudy",
//! "Light Rain", "Fog") is mapped onto the game's [`WeatherKind`] conditions.
//! Because the NWS reports "Fog/Mist" or "Haze" for anything under about 7 miles
//! of visibility -- ordinary muggy summer air -- the fog mapping is gated on the
//! station's measured visibility, so only genuinely low visibility becomes the
//! game's fog.
//!
//! Port of `freight_fate/sim/real_weather.py`. The network rides the
//! [`HttpTransport`] seam from `real_traffic` (through [`NwsFetcher`], the
//! `_default_fetch` machinery); tests inject a `fetch` closure exactly as the
//! Python tests did, plus the monotonic and wall clocks.
