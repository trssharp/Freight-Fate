//! Live construction along a candidate route, read the way a dispatcher
//! reads 511 before choosing a lane: which of the sensible routes carries
//! reported construction, how many minutes it costs, and whether the road is
//! closed outright.
//!
//! Dispatch has no map of roadwork of its own. The zones a drive meets are
//! drawn when the trip starts, and the only construction known before the
//! wheels turn is what the state 511 feeds report. So this module reads the
//! same provider cache the trip will read, on the two or three route options
//! `World::supported_route_options` already ranks by distance, and re-ranks
//! them by drive time plus the construction delay. A route through a
//! reported full closure sorts last whatever its time: a dispatcher does not
//! send a truck at a closed road while another way exists.
//!
//! The active National Weather Service warnings ride the same ranking
//! (`real_weather_alerts`): a blizzard, ice storm, hurricane or tornado
//! warning on a route sorts it last like a closure, and a winter storm,
//! high wind, flash flood or dense fog warning prices the alerted stretch at
//! that condition's safe speed.
//!
//! Every number here is derived from the feed and the deadline model, and
//! says so: the delay through a zone is its length at the zone's limit minus
//! the same length at the route's own planned pace. No queue penalty is
//! guessed for a lane closure, because the feeds carry no demand to derive
//! one from; a closure costs only its slower stretch until they do.
