//! API endpoints for all 50 US states (plus DC): the `STATE_APIS` registry

// ---- The endpoint registry ------------------------------------------------

/// One state's 511 configuration.
///
/// `parser` selects the response format handler:
///   "ohgo"    — Ohio OHGO native JSON format
///   "iteris"  — Iteris/INRIX-platform 511 websites (shared `/Events` format)
///   "wzdx"    — Work Zone Data Exchange (GeoJSON FeatureCollection)
///   "cars"    — Castle Rock CARS GraphQL platform.  `events_endpoint` and
///                `construction_endpoint` hold the deployment's layer slug
///                for each fetch (slugs vary per site), and `bounds` is the
///                statewide "south,west,north,east" query box.
///   "list511" — The 511 site's own list JSON.  `events_endpoint` holds the
///                list layer name (e.g. "Incidents"); text rides
///                POST /List/GetData/<layer> and coordinates come from
///                GET /map/mapIcons/<layer>, joined on the event id.
///   "no_api"  — No working public 511 API.  Returns empty data so the
///                simulation falls back to procedurally generated construction
///                zones without log warnings.
///
/// `construction_parser` (optional) overrides `parser` for the
/// construction fetch only, for sites whose incidents and work zones live on
/// different platforms (Florida and New York: list511 incidents + WZDx zones).
