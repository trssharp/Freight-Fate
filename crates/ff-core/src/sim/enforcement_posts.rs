//! Enforcement posts: the places on a corridor where an officer may be
//! sitting (port of `freight_fate/sim/enforcement_posts.py`).
//!
//! A post is a PLACE WITH A BODY. It sits at a milepost, not across a span,
//! and observes up-corridor as far as its method reaches. Whether anyone is
//! sitting there today is settled once, when the trip is built, from the
//! trip seed -- most posts are empty most of the time, which is what makes
//! the staffed ones matter. Whether that body notices *you* is the graded
//! decision in `enforcement_observe`.
//!
//! Every kind is anchored to data the world already carries: median
//! crossovers off `leg.interchanges`, roving patrols (the trooper NPC is the
//! body), work-zone details on construction zones, scale aprons and open
//! scales on `weigh_station` stops, urban units on the urban radius, CMV
//! units on truck corridors, chain controls on `chain_law_areas`.
//!
//! Presence is not difficulty: placement and staffing read nothing from
//! `hazard_scale`, and there is no player setting here any more.
