//! Where a station's rotation stands after so many seconds on the air.
//!
//! A station keeps broadcasting whether or not the truck is tuned to it, so
//! tuning back has to land where the station is *now* rather than restarting
//! its shuffled order at track one, second zero. This module replays the
//! rotation's own rules -- songs, with a host break every
//! [`RADIO_TRACKS_PER_HOST_BREAK`] songs -- forward over an airtime and hands
//! back the cue the playback loop should resume from.
//!
//! Everything here is a pure function of the station's seed key, its track
//! order and the airtime, so the same trip always hears the same station in
//! the same place. Nothing draws from a clock or an unseeded generator.
