//! Spoken message pairs: one definition, both renderings side by side.
//!
//! The terse contract (docs/speech-priority-research.md, R4) promises that
//! terse mode tells the player what to *do* and what it *cost*, and nothing
//! else -- in the shortest form the ontology allows. Making that real used
//! to depend on every call site remembering to hand-branch on the verbosity
//! setting, which is how 79 branches came to cover 711 speech call sites,
//! and how the terse hazard call drifted onto a synonym nobody diffed
//! against the help text.
//!
//! So the pair lives in ONE definition: a builder in this module renders the
//! normal and terse forms of a message side by side, where a reviewer sees
//! both, and the delivery layer (`GameContext::say` / `say_event`) picks the
//! rendering the player's speech mode asks for. Drift between the two forms
//! is structurally impossible, and the safety-critical pairs are pinned by
//! copy tests on top of that.
//!
//! Two rules bound every terse rendering (the research doc's R4):
//!
//! - **Compress words, never certainty.** A qualifier that changes a
//!   decision survives terse; parking certainty keeps all five values
//!   distinguishable.
//! - **A fixed slot grammar, recorded in docs/ontology.md.** Hazards speak
//!   as [thing, distance, target speed]; stops as [name, exit, distance,
//!   qualifier]. A bare trailing number is only parseable because the frame
//!   never shuffles, so no terse line may reorder its slots.
//!
//! Port of `freight_fate/speech_text.py`.
