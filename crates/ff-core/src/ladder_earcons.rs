//! Synthesized earcons for the categories the S4 driving speech ladder
//! retires to sound (R14, `docs/ontology.md`'s "Terse speech grammar").
//!
//! `NAVIGATION_ADVISORY`, `COACHING`, `CONFIRMATION` and `STATUS` have no existing cue that means what an earcon
//! standing in for either needs to mean -- every candidate already carries a
//! meaning of its own (the overspeed chime says "you are speeding", not "here
//! was a tip"), and reusing one would teach a player two different things under
//! one sound. These two tones are synthesized rather than shipped, the same way
//! the enforcement signature is (`states/driving_siren.py`): pure arithmetic,
//! so the same build always produces the same bytes and nothing needs an LFS
//! entry.
//!
//! Deliberately plainer than the enforcement signature, which has to survive
//! being heard against radio static and repeats twice on purpose. These two only
//! need to be tellable apart from each other and from everything else already
//! playing: coaching is two rising notes (a tip offered), status is one short
//! low note (something changed, look at it later if you want to), and the road
//! ahead note is two falling notes (the road is about to do something) -- the
//! opposite contour to coaching's, so the pair cannot be confused at speed --
//! and confirmation is one short high note, an octave over status, so "that
//! worked" and "something changed" part on pitch alone.
//!
//! CONFIRMATION used to borrow the shipped "Hazard clear" chime rather than
//! have a tone of its own, which broke this module's own rule: that chime
//! already means "you got past the hazard". At quiet it fired for every
//! silenced confirmation, so the owner heard hazard-cleared while a hazard was
//! still live and the truck was braking for it (playtest, 2026-08-17).
//!
//! Port of `freight_fate/ladder_earcons.py`. The sample arithmetic keeps the
//! Python operation order (Python's `int()` truncation, `math.sin` per
//! sample), so the WAV bytes are identical to the Python build's -- pinned by
//! SHA-256 in the tests.
