//! What every road cue means, as data.
//!
//! Freight Fate teaches its cues at seventy miles an hour: the first time a
//! player hears one, something is already happening. That is fine for the engine
//! and useless for the edge ladder, the stop bar and the jake stages, where the
//! sound IS the information. This catalog is what the Learn game sounds screen
//! reads -- one entry per cue that carries a decision, with the recipe for
//! playing it exactly the way the road plays it.
//!
//! Rules this file lives by:
//!
//! * **Pure data.** No audio engine, no states. It is read by the screen and
//!   by tests, and it must stay cheap and headless.
//! * **Canonical nouns.** Every `name` is the word `docs/ontology.md` already
//!   uses. A catalog that invents a second name for the rumble strip is worse
//!   than no catalog.
//! * **Faithful recipes.** Volumes and pans are copied from the call site that
//!   plays the cue in the drive, so what a player learns here is what they hear
//!   out there. Panned cues demo both sides, because the side is the point.
//! * **Every exclusion is on the record.** A cue left out goes in
//!   [`SELF_EXPLANATORY`] with its reason, and the completeness test in
//!   `tests/test_sound_catalog.py` fails on anything in neither list.
//!
//! Port of `freight_fate/sound_catalog.py`. The demo sequencer that plays an
//! entry (`freight_fate/sound_demo.py`) is the [`demo`] submodule.
