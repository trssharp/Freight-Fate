//! The safety record: how interesting this driver looks to an inspector
//! (port of `freight_fate/models/safety_record.py`).
//!
//! Real commercial enforcement does not pick trucks at random. Every carrier
//! carries a score built from its inspection and violation history, and the
//! screening software at a scale reads it before anyone looks at the truck. A
//! clean operator is waved through year after year; a dirty one is pulled in
//! every time, which feels less like bad luck than like being followed.
//!
//! That is the dial this file provides, and it is what makes a clean career
//! pleasant and a dirty one relentless -- without the game having to cheat, and
//! without a clean driver's police contacts ever costing them anything.
//!
//! **Spoken as "safety record". Never as ISS, never as CSA, never as a score.**
//! Those are trade acronyms; a player hearing "your ISS is 78" learns nothing.
//! The number is internal. What the game says out loud is a band.
//!
//! Higher is worse, matching the real convention: 0 is a driver nobody has any
//! reason to look at, 100 is one every screening lane flags.
//!
//! The real score weighs the last 24 months, so a bad stretch fades. Here the
//! citations, serious violations, out-of-service orders and fatigue events
//! count inside [`SAFETY_RECORD_WINDOW_DAYS`], the one game year reputation
//! and the carrier's review already use. Clean inspections stay a lifetime
//! credit.
