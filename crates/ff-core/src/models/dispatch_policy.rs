//! Dispatch autonomy policy: who picks the load and who picks the route
//! (port of `freight_fate/models/dispatch_policy.py`).
//!
//! Freedom to choose freight and routing is earned across the 30-level
//! career instead of being available from minute one:
//!
//! - New company hires are *assigned* a load and a route by dispatch. Their
//!   real agency is accept or decline, and declines go on the service record.
//! - Senior company drivers pick their own loads from the board, but still
//!   run the lane dispatch gives them.
//! - Leased-on owner-operators and independent authority choose both -- that
//!   is the independence they bought into.
//!
//! The policy is a pure function of business status and career level,
//! mirroring `career_level_guidance` / `career_objective`. State code
//! consults it to decide whether to present a menu or auto-assign; it never
//! mutates saves.
