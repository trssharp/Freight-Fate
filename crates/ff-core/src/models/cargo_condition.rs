//! Truck damage is the driver's problem. Cargo damage is the customer's, and
//! that is a different and much larger kind of money. Under the Carmack
//! Amendment (49 U.S.C. 14706) a motor carrier is liable for the actual loss or
//! injury to the property it carries: accept a clean bill of lading at origin,
//! deliver short or damaged, and the carrier owes the value of the freight
//! unless it can prove one of a short list of defences. At the dock the receiver
//! inspects, notes any exception on the bill of lading -- the OS&D notation,
//! Over, Short and Damaged -- and, if the load is bad enough, refuses it
//! outright. The carrier is then holding freight nobody will pay for and a claim
//! besides, and the driver delivered nothing.
//!
//! So the ladder here is the real one, and it is deliberately harsher at the top
//! than any truck-damage consequence: clean, an exception noted, a claim paid,
//! and the load rejected.
//!
//! The meter is condition, not value: 0 is freight in the state it was tendered,
//! 100 is a trailer of scrap. What moves it is what already moves in the sim --
//! hard braking, taking a bend faster than it is signed for, hitting something --
//! scaled by how well the freight in question survives being thrown about.
//! Nothing here knows about the window; the driving layer feeds it and speaks it.
