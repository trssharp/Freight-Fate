//! The credential ladder: every license add-on a driver can train for,
//! in one catalog.
//!
//! Four rungs, modeled on the real credential structure of U.S. trucking
//! (49 CFR 383 endorsements and restrictions, 49 CFR 380 training rules,
//! TSA vetting for hazmat and ports):
//!
//! - **Training** (act one): removing a restriction a fresh CDL carries.
//!   The E restriction -- automatic transmissions only -- is removed by a
//!   skills retest in a manual truck (49 CFR 383.95(c)), not by a fee.
//! - **Certificates** (early-mid): carrier training, not CDL law. The
//!   carrier sponsors each at its listed level once dispatch trusts you
//!   with the freight; paying for the course yourself unlocks it early.
//!   Flatbed load securement is real carrier onboarding (the rules are
//!   federal -- 49 CFR 393 subpart I -- but the training is the company's).
//! - **Endorsements** (mid-late): the real CDL letters. T doubles, N tank,
//!   H hazmat -- knowledge tests under 49 CFR 383.93(c), and for H a
//!   fingerprint background check (49 CFR 1572) that takes real weeks:
//!   the endorsement cannot issue until the check clears. Holding both N
//!   and H is the X combination (49 CFR 383.153(a)(9)(v)).
//! - **Specialist** (late): credentials that are not CDL letters at all.
//!   TWIC, the port security card (MTSA; TSA-issued, ~$125, weeks to
//!   clear). LCV, the longer-combination-vehicle certificate -- issued by
//!   the training provider and held in the carrier's file, never by the
//!   DMV (49 CFR 380.107(c)) -- which requires the T endorsement, real
//!   experience, and a clean recent record (49 CFR 380.203).
//!
//! Every credential is stored by key in `Career.purchased_endorsements`
//! (level-granted ones are derived, exactly as before); the catalog is
//! exported to the orinks.net validator, so a new key here is an exporter
//! regen and a staging deploy in the same change.
