//! Dispatch-assigned company tractors, banded by career level (port of
//! `freight_fate/models/carrier_fleet.py`).
//!
//! Real fleets do not let a new hire shop for a truck: dispatch hands out
//! whatever the yard has, and better equipment follows seniority. Company
//! drivers therefore run a carrier-assigned tractor chosen from a level-band
//! fleet pool. The pick is deterministic per driver and carrier, so the same
//! career always meets the same truck, but two drivers at the same level can
//! be handed different iron.
//!
//! Junior drivers slip-seat, which is what actually happens to a new hire at
//! a big carrier: no truck is *yours*, and the yard hands you whatever is
//! free and suited to the run. So below [`DEDICATED_TRUCK_LEVEL`] the tractor
//! is chosen per load out of a small pool of spares, matched to the work -- a
//! bunk for a run that cannot be finished inside one driving shift, a
//! heavy-spec driveline for a heavy load, a day cab for a day's worth of city
//! stops. Seniority ends that: from [`DEDICATED_TRUCK_LEVEL`] the driver has
//! one assigned tractor and keeps it, which is the whole point of seniority.
//!
//! The pool is small and stable on purpose. Each tractor keeps its own wear,
//! damage, and fuel (`Profile.truck_conditions`), so a driver cycling through
//! three spares watches three trucks age rather than climbing into a factory
//! fresh one every load.
//!
//! Owner-operators are outside this module: after the level-18 buy-in the
//! tractor on the profile is player property (see `trucks::TRUCK_CATALOG`).
