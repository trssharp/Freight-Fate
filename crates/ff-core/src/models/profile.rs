//! Player profile with atomic packed-container save/load (port of
//! `freight_fate/models/profile.py`).
//!
//! Saves are `.ffsave` files: a magic header plus zlib-compressed JSON, signed
//! inside with this install's HMAC key. The container keeps casual
//! hand-editing out of career state; the signature is the actual tamper
//! check, and a failed check marks the profile as modified rather than
//! refusing to load it. Plain `.json` saves from older versions still load
//! and are converted in place.
//!
//! On Windows and Linux, Freight Fate is portable: profiles and settings live
//! in a `saves` directory inside the game's own main directory -- next to the
//! executable in packaged builds, the project root when running from source.
//! macOS uses the per-user `~/Library/Application Support/FreightFate`
//! folder, and so do Windows and Linux when the game's own folder cannot be
//! written (see [`paths`]). Override the location with `FREIGHT_FATE_DATA_DIR`
//! (which the tests use).
//!
//! When running from source, `FREIGHT_FATE_SKIP_SAVE_SIGNING=1` skips the
//! save-signature check (the file is re-signed locally on load) so arbitrary
//! save files can be loaded for testing. Packaged builds ignore the flag.
//!
//! Saves are atomic: written to a temp file, then renamed over the old save,
//! so a crash mid-write can never corrupt an existing profile.
