//! The driver's enforcement record: citations, serious violations, CDL standing
//! (port of `freight_fate/models/enforcement.py`).
//!
//! This models real US commercial-driver enforcement rather than a softened
//! version of it, because the softened version taught players nothing: a driver
//! could run from troopers twice, take spike strips twice, and keep every load on
//! the board.
//!
//! Sources for every number here:
//!
//! * 49 CFR 383.51 Table 2 (serious traffic violations). Speeding 15 mph or more
//!   over the limit, reckless driving, improper lane changes, and following too
//!   closely are serious violations. A **second** conviction inside three years
//!   disqualifies the CDL for 60 days; a **third or subsequent** for 120 days.
//! * 49 CFR 383.51 Table 1 (major offenses). Using a commercial vehicle in the
//!   commission of a felony -- which is what fleeing and eluding a police officer
//!   is in most states -- disqualifies the CDL for one year on the first offense
//!   and for **life** on the second. Leaving the scene carries the same pair.
//! * CDL speeding fines. The top-of-range fine for a first offense of 15 mph or
//!   more over the limit is 2,500 dollars (Illinois; Arizona matches it), so that
//!   is the ceiling a single speeding citation can reach here.
//! * 49 CFR 386 Appendix B. Violating an out-of-service order carries a civil
//!   penalty of not less than 3,961 dollars for a first conviction and not less
//!   than 7,924 dollars for a second.
//! * Work zone penalty doubling. Nevada, Texas and Pennsylvania are among the
//!   states that double the fine for a violation committed inside a marked work
//!   zone, whatever the violation was. Every citation here doubles the same way
//!   inside a construction zone, and the driver is told that is why.
//! * FMCSA CSA Unsafe Driving BASIC. Every roadside citation is weighted and
//!   follows the *carrier*, which is why a company driver's citations cost the
//!   carrier's standing and eventually the job, while an owner-operator simply
//!   pays and watches their own authority.
//!
//! Nothing here is harsher than the real rule. Where the real rule gives a range,
//! this takes the severe end of it.
//!
//! Profile access goes through [`StandingProfile`]: the Python read these
//! fields with `getattr`, and `models::profile::Profile` implements the trait.

// bypass reached 19,800 dollars by twenty priors, and 39,600 inside roadwork,
// against a federal ceiling of 10,000 for the real offense.
//
// The binding constraint is solvency, not statute. An owner-operator who owes
// more than ``solvency.REPOSSESSION_FLOOR`` (12,000) loses the tractor. A
// single citation must never be able to reach that on its own, or one traffic
// stop repossesses a truck -- which no player would read as a rule, only as
// the game breaking. Capping the step at 2.0 leaves the construction-zone

// zone as a repeat offender, at 10,000. Punishing, survivable, and clear of
// the floor.

// Deliberately capping the STEP and not the total: the zone doubling stays
