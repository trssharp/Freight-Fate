//! Every integration test in this crate, in ONE binary.
//!
//! Cargo links and runs a separate binary for each `tests/*.rs`, and runs
//! those binaries one after another. Collapsing them here means one link
//! and one process, with the tests running as parallel threads inside it.
//! Files live in `tests/it/`, which cargo does not auto-discover, so this
//! file is the only target and the `mod` lines below are what includes
//! them. A new test file needs a line here.
//!
//! TWO FILES ARE DELIBERATELY NOT HERE. data_baked and data_map_correction
//! each point the whole process at a different baked data root through
//! FREIGHT_FATE_DATA_ROOT, and the loader caches what it finds, so in one
//! process whichever ran first decided what the other one saw. They keep a
//! binary each, which is what process-global state costs.
