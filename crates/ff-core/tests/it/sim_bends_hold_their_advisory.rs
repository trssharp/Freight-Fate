//! Curve assistance brakes to the bend's advisory and hands the lane model the

//! lost to a number the game itself just spoke, and the driver has no move that
//! helps: the assists are already doing everything they have.
//!
//! That is what an agent drive down AZ-260 into Payson hit on 2026-09-19 --
//! hands off, every assist on, at the advisory, off the pavement -- so this
//! sweeps the shipped bake rather than the one bend that happened to be
//! reported. Every mainline curve, at its own advisory, held for as long as the
//! truck is really in it.
