//! The 2026-08-23 map-data correction, asked of the Rust side.
//!
//! `data_baked.rs` already proves the baked container says the same thing as
//! the JSON tree. What it cannot prove is that either says the RIGHT thing,
//! and the failure mode this file exists for is the quiet one: the Rust
//! client shipping an older world than the Python tree carries, which reaches
//! a tester as a Rust bug rather than as stale data.
//!
//! So these are three facts a driver would notice, each the visible end of
//! one repair in that correction, checked through the loaders the runtime
//! itself uses -- and checked against the baked container, because that is
//! what a tester actually runs.
//!
//! # Why these are `#[ignore]`
//!
//! Building that container means baking the whole tree, about twelve
//! seconds, which is why this file has its own binary (it repoints
//! `FREIGHT_FATE_DATA_ROOT` for the whole process) and why it is deselected
//! from the default run alongside `data_baked`. Run it deliberately:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test -p ff-core --test data_map_correction -- --ignored
//! ```
//!
//! See the module note on `data_baked.rs` for what these two are guarding
//! and where they belong in the build and in CI.
