//! Shared rigging for the `test_driving_cruise_weather.py` port.
//!
//! # What replaced the monkeypatches
//!
//! The Python file reached a deterministic road by patching methods on the
//! live trip:
//!
//! | Python | here |
//! |---|---|
//! | `open_limits(driving)` -- `speed_limit_at -> (200, None)` | [`bench_road`] bakes a 200 mph `SpeedLimitSample` on the leg, which is the record `speed_limit_at` reads |
//! | `trip.speed_limit_at = lambda m: (L, "reason")` | a [`Zone`] over the whole road, which is how `speed_limit_at` returns a reason at all |
//! | `trip.grade_at = lambda m: g` | a baked `GradeSegment` over the whole leg |
//! | `trip.traffic_context = lambda: None` | an empty traffic manager with the rolling bubble off |
//! | `pygame.key.get_pressed` -> `NoKeys`/`Keys` | [`hold`] / [`release_keys`] writing the drive's real held-key set |
//!
//! Rust has no seam for an inherent method, so each of these builds the road
//! that ANSWERS the way the patch did. That is stricter than the patch was:
//! the whole trip is fixed rather than whatever route dispatch drew.
//!
//! # Where the transcript comes from
//!
//! Python patched `ctx.say`/`ctx.say_event` and so recorded every line the
//! states SUBMITTED. The harness here records at `ctx.speech`, below the
//! driving verbosity ladder and the event pacer, so [`spoken`] is what a
//! player actually hears. Where that changes an expectation the case says so
//! at the assertion.
