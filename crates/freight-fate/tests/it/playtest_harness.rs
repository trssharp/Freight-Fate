//! The playtest harness's own coverage (port of
//! `tests/test_playtest_harness.py`).
//!
//! These are the gate for the 119 transcript test files that code against
//! [`PlaytestHarness`]: if the harness cannot start a route, drive it, and
//! report what was heard, nothing downstream means anything.
//!
//! # What is ignored and why
//!
//! The Python file drove most of its cases through `start_delivery`, which
//! walks the real menus from the main menu to the wheel. That walk works:
//! `states::city::launch_driving` builds the real `DrivingState`, and the
//! pull-in beat at the destination gate opens the dock menu over a drive
//! that is still live, so those cases run as written.
//!
//! One delivery case is still parked, and its `blocked:` reason names what
//! on: the event pacer measures "would this line start after its moment"
//! on the wall clock, and a harness delivery covers hundreds of miles in
//! seconds of it, so the road's ambient lines -- state lines, city
//! passings -- are dropped as stale. The Python harness recorded above the
//! pacer and never saw it.
//!
//! A handful of Python cases patched a method on the live drive
//! (`_upcoming_exit_stop`, `trip.speed_limit_at`, `trip.grade_at`) with
//! `monkeypatch.setattr`. Rust has no equivalent for an inherent method, so
//! those are ported as far as they go and marked with what they would need.
