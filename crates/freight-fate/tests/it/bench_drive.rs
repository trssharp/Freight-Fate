//! Frame-time benchmark for the per-frame drive loop (`DrivingState::update`
//! -> `states/driving_updates`).
//!
//! Deliberately `#[ignore]`d: it is a measurement, not an assertion, and a
//! benchmark run in a normal `cargo test` would only add seconds to the
//! suite. The Python counterpart was `tools/bench_drive.py` (deleted with the
//! Python game); the two built the same drive (Denver -> Cheyenne, `trip_seed = 0`, start hour 12, engine
//! running, parking brake off, accelerator held) and ticked the same number
//! of frames at the same fixed dt, so the two numbers were comparable. The method
//! and every asymmetry that could not be removed are written up in
//! `docs/superpowers/rust-port-benchmarks.md`.
//!
//! Run it in RELEASE -- a debug build of the sim is several times slower and
//! says nothing about what a player would get:
//!
//! ```text
//! CARGO_TARGET_DIR=target/bench cargo test --release -p freight-fate \
//!     --test it -- bench_drive --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! (`--test it`, not `--test bench_drive`: every integration test in this
//! crate is one binary now. See `tests/it/main.rs`.)
//!
//! `FF_BENCH_FRAMES` and `FF_BENCH_WARMUP` override the frame counts (the
//! Python side reads the same two variables).
