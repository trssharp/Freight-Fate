//! Port of `tests/test_cloud_public_career.py`: choosing which career fronts
//! the public profile, from the Cloud backup menu.
//!
//! One career is the player's public face; the rest stay private cloud
//! backups. The list says which career is public, each backed-up career
//! offers to become it behind a spoken confirmation, and the choice goes to
//! orinks.net.
