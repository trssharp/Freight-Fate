//! Leaving the interstate the way a truck really does (owner-approved
//! redesign, 2026-09-24): road speed down the mainline, the braking done in
//! the deceleration lane past the gore, the exit speed named there, and a
//! ramp curve that costs something when it is taken hot.
//!
//! Every case runs on a bench road: one straight leg with one posted number
//! and one grade, and one invented truck stop on it, so the Green Book
//! numbers each case pins come from the road the case builds and not from
//! whichever corridor a fresh career draws.
