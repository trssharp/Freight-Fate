//! The origin facility's street chain, driven OUT of the gate.
//!
//! The arrival side was measured and pinned in `states_driving_approach_sweep`:
//! a delivery's last mile of city streets had no real-time pin, so the ground
//! closed four to seven times faster than the brakes could answer for and the
//! truck crossed its own gate at up to twenty-four miles an hour. The fix was
//! one flag on the chain trip.
//!
//! `begin_departure_chain` sets no such flag, so the streets a truck drives
//! LEAVING a facility still run compressed. Whether that costs the driver
//! anything is a different question with a different answer -- there is no
//! assist braking to a gate out here -- but a corner that arrives faster than
//! a driver can take it is a defect wherever it happens, so it had to be
//! measured rather than assumed either way. This file drives the departure the
//! way its twin drives the arrival: one chain-capable facility per state, in a
//! fixed order, every run seeded and its weather pinned, and the driver holding
//! the game's own advised number for whatever corner is in play.
//!
//! THE ANSWER, and what each test here is for.
//!
//! The STREETS are clean and want no pin. `controlled_turn` already holds the
//! clock at real time from the moment a corner enters its own window until the
//! corner resolves, and that window is sized in real seconds, so a corner's
//! run-up is never compressed: 0 to 13 feet of compressed ground per departure
//! in the last tenth of a mile before a corner, against a truck seventy feet
//! long, all of it the frame or two between one corner resolving and the next
//! latching. Pinning the whole clock to real time changes the outcome of two
//! corners in a hundred and twenty-five, and the arrival chain -- which IS
//! pinned -- scores the same on every corner measure. Copying the arrival's
//! flag here would have been copying the flag that exists rather than the
//! fault that exists.
//!
//! What the sweep DID find is two faults of its own, both fixed with it: the
//! acceleration lane that ends the chain is a real length of road spent by
//! compressed ground, and the destination approach assist could not tell a
//! departure from an arrival and braked for the on-ramp as though it were the
//! dock.
//!
//! What it measures, per corner: how much road was left when the corner was
//! first spoken about, how many REAL seconds of hearing-and-acting time that
//! road was worth at the pace the ground was actually moving, and how the
//! corner ended -- taken, missed, or never judged at all. The arrival chain is
//! measured with the same ruler, as the control, behind `arrival_control_probe`.
