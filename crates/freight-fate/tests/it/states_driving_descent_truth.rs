//! "Descent control cannot hold this grade" -- said only where it is true.
//!
//! Owner, live playtest, I-70 west of Vail, 2026-08-24. Three of these inside
//! one minute, and the G key answered in between:
//!
//! ```text
//!   00:05:23  Level road. Nothing steep in the next 15 miles, but a 2.2
//!             percent downgrade starts in a quarter mile.
//!   00:05:25  [event] Descent control cannot hold this grade. Apply service
//!             brakes.
//!   00:05:44  Level road. Nothing steep in the next 15 miles.
//! ```
//!
//! Two statements about the same piece of road that cannot both be true, and
//! the one that costs the drive is the warning: it tells a blind driver to get
//! on the brakes on a road the truck's own instrument calls level.
//!
//! What was actually happening, measured on his own route in
//! [`the_warning_stays_off_the_owners_i70_run`] before the fix: eight
//! warnings between Silverthorne and Glenwood Springs, EVERY one of them while
//! the drums were applied between 0.44 and 0.70 and the truck was losing three
//! to five miles an hour a second, on dips a quarter of a mile long. The
//! sentence fired on a single frame's arithmetic -- speed more than ten over
//! the ceiling interactive descent control had just imposed
//! ([`DESCENT_SAFE_MAX_MPH`], 55) -- which on a 75 mph road with cruise set at
//! 80 is true on the FIRST frame of every dip, before the control has done
//! anything at all, and while it is about to do it successfully.
//!
//! So the cases below pin the three things that make the sentence honest, and
//! the fourth that keeps it from being merely quiet:
//!
//! * a hill that genuinely beats the control still says so, in these exact
//!   words;
//! * a dip the drums hold says nothing;
//! * the G readout and the descent control never disagree about one moment of
//!   road, because they now ask the same physics the same question
//!   (`TruckState::net_accel_mph_per_s` against `GRADE_HOLDING_MPH_PER_S`);
//! * and the retarder still stays down on shallow road, which is the rule
//!   landed earlier the same day.
