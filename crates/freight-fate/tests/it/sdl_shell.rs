//! The windowed shell boots under SDL's dummy video driver -- every
//! headless run (CI, `--agent-server` under `FREIGHT_FATE_NO_SPEECH`, the
//! playtest benches) goes through it. The native window handle taken for
//! the nonblocking Windows shutdown does not exist there, and the sdl2
//! crate panics rather than errs when asked for it, which killed every
//! headless windowed boot the day the handle arrived (2026-09-01).
