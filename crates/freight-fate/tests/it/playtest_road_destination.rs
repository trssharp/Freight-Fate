//! `--playtest-road --find destination`: does the finder land the truck at

//!
//! A finder that compiles but drops you in the wrong place is worse than no
//! finder: the owner drives, hears nothing, and reads that as the fix not
//! working. So placement is proved on the transcript -- from the mile the
//! tool chooses, driving forward produces the destination-exit call, and
