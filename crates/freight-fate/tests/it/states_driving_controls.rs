//! `states/driving_controls.rs` and `states/driving_speed_control.rs`: the
//! discrete key and pad surface at the wheel, and the speed-control session
//! around adaptive cruise and the speed keeper.
//!
//! Ported from `tests/test_info_keys.py`, `test_cruise_steps.py` (its
//! App-driven half; the pure `cruise_step_target` grid is in
//! `states_driving_core.rs`), `test_driving_manual_controls.py`,
//! `test_pedal_latch_assists.py` (brake latch, and that the throttle key never
//! catches one), `test_driving_modes.py` (the keeper's ease window) and
//! `test_turn_commitment.py` (the keeper's corner planner) -- everything a real
//! `DrivingState` can answer without the per-frame loop or a menu state. The
//! rest are listed here, ignored, with their bodies noted, so the two suites
//! diff by name.
//!
//! `tests/test_controls_reference.py` is already ported in full as
//! `app_controls_reference.rs`; it is not repeated here.
