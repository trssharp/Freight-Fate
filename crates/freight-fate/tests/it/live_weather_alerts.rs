//! National Weather Service warnings, read keyless onto the route: dispatch
//! briefs them at the pickup departure and plans around the ones nobody
//! drives into, and the cab reads one out as the truck drives into it
//! (`sim/real_weather_alerts.rs`, `city_pickup.rs`, `live_sources.rs`).
//!
//! The alerts provider is the offline one with its cache seeded. Real
//! weather has to be on for the warnings to count, which also builds the
//! drive's live sky provider; the test network guard refuses its fetches,
//! so nothing here reaches api.weather.gov.
