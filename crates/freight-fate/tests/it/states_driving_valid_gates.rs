//! The `say_event(valid=...)` gates, all of them, asked the one question the
//! port kept getting wrong.
//!
//! A queued line carries a "is this still true?" test. The pacer consults it
//! only on the rescue path: a ROUTE or CRITICAL line cut off mid-sentence is
//! offered back once so an interruption cannot destroy it, and the test is
//! what stops the words coming back after the moment they described has
//! passed.
//!
//! Python's tests read the live drive (`self.trip.position_mi < scale_mi`,
//! `self._hazard_deadline is not None`). A Rust validity closure is `'static`
//! and cannot borrow the drive, and in four places the port substituted
//! something that only looks the same: a projection onto the wall clock, or
//! an answer taken once at submission time. Both say "still true" for a
//! driver who has already dealt with the thing -- a hazard dodged, a bend
//! taken, a gore passed, a key pressed -- because neither reading moves when
//! the truck does.
//!
//! Each test here queues the real line through the real state, changes the
//! fact the line depends on, and then cuts the channel with an urgent line.
//! Every one of them fails against a clock projection or a snapshot, and
//! passes against a live reading.
