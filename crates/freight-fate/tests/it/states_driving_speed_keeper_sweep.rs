//! Does the speed keeper -- and adaptive cruise beside it -- hold the posted
//! number?
//!
//! Owner, 2026-08-24: "Sometimes it doesn't hold the posted speeds and could
//! probably hold the posted speed through a corner." Two claims, measured
//! apart, because they are not the same claim.
//!
//! 1. HOLDING. Run the controllers with nothing but the game touching the
//!    truck and record the number they owe against the speed actually held.
//!    Decomposed on purpose: WHAT THE CONTROLLER DECIDED to hold is one
//!    question and WHETHER THE TRUCK GOT THERE is another, and a rig that only
//!    subtracts posted from speed reports the first as the second.
//!
//! 2. BENDS. Both controllers ease under the posted number for a bend on
//!    purpose, because a bend carries its own advisory and the posted number
//!    is not always takeable through it. The question is not whether they
//!    ease -- they should -- but whether they ease for bends the truck could
//!    take at the posted number. Three outcomes per bend, and the rate of
//!    each.
//!
//! Every run pins its trip seed and its weather. An unseeded delivery draws
//! its own road and its own sky, and an ice day changes what a bend advises.
//!
//! WHAT THE MEASUREMENT FOUND, 2026-08-24. Twenty corridors, one per state,
//! 1.46 million measured frames with nothing but the game driving:
//!
//! * 146 stretches of a tenth of a mile or more spent more than two mph under
//!   the number owed. 138 of them are TRACKING -- the controller published the
//!   right number and the truck was under it, on a climb, on a descent, or in
//!   limp mode after a ninety-minute unattended drive wore the engine past 75
//!   percent. Every one of those the game already names out loud.
//! * 8 are DECISIONS, where the controller chose a number under posted: six
//!   easing for a lower posted limit ahead, one for a bend, one for the
//!   predictive crest sag. All announced, all designed.
//! * The keeper engaged on none of them, because the keeper lives in zones
//!   and on facility streets and these are open corridors. Its own numbers
//!   come from the zone bench below, which is where the defect was: see
//!   `keeper_holds_the_posted_number_up_a_grade`.
