//! WHERE the retarder's line is, measured against the drums rather than argued.
//!
//! Owner report, 2026-08-24: "The jake activates on every single descent it
//! seems, even shallow descent like 1-3 percent. It should only activate on
//! descents that are steep where service brakes can't handle, like 6%+. That's
//! just a number I threw out there."
//!
//! Six percent was flagged as a guess and is treated as one here. So was the
//! two percent that shipped -- see `JAKE_ZONE_EXEMPT_GRADE_PCT`, which is the
//! release edge of a SPEECH hysteresis pair and never had a brake in it.
//! `DrivingState::retarder_warranted` derives the answer instead, from FHWA's
//! Grade Severity Rating System criterion (grade, length and gross weight
//! against a drum-temperature ceiling) evaluated on the truck's own brake heat
//! model:
//!
//! ```text
//!   T_settle = T_ambient + P_brake / (C * k(v))     >=  fade onset ?
//! ```
//!
//! This file is what stops that being a nice argument. It drives real frames
//! down real sustained grades with NO retarder available at all, records how
//! hot the drums actually get, and checks two things:
//!
//! 1. the closed form predicts the temperature the simulated drums reach, and
//! 2. `retarder_warranted` says yes for exactly the grades that cook them.
//!
//! Run `cargo test -p freight-fate --test it jake_line -- --nocapture` to read
//! the table.
