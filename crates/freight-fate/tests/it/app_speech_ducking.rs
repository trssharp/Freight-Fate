//! Port of the `App`/`GameContext` half of `tests/test_speech_ducking.py`:
//! game audio steps back while the event voice speaks (R13, XAG 105).
//!
//! A warning must survive a loud cab -- engine, weather, and the radio --
//! without the voice itself getting louder. The duck engages the moment a
//! line reaches the event channel and restores on the pacer's own
//! projection of when the voice falls silent: no polling of the speech
//! backend, which cannot be asked. (The backend half -- which channels the
//! duck scales -- is `tests/audio_speech_ducking.rs`.)
