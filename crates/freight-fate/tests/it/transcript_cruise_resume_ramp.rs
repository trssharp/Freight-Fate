//! Resuming (or setting) cruise to a high target must ease up, not floor it
//! (port of `tests/test_cruise_resume_ramp.py`).
//!
//! The tester report (Shane): Shift+K resumes cruise to a high remembered
//! target (85 mph) from low road speed. The old proportional loop saw the
//! whole error at once and commanded wide-open throttle. On flat ground the
//! fuel governor caps that -- loud, but harmless. On a downgrade cruise adding
//! fuel while gravity is already driving the engine toward redline is what fed
//! the over-rev during the automatic box's between-shift hold, "the engine is
//! screaming at redline".
//!
//! The fix has three parts, each covered here:
//!
//! * a working setpoint that eases from the engage speed up to the target at a
//!   bounded rate, so a big resume error never lands on the pedal at once;
//! * an RPM ceiling that tapers cruise's throttle to nothing as the engine
//!   nears the governor, so cruise never feeds an over-rev -- the
//!   descent-control and retarder staging own the grade;
//! * an engage gate, so on the open road cruise waits for road speed before it
//!   engages, the same bridge the zone-preceded automatic resume already gave
//!   the tester a behaviour he trusts.
//!
//! Note on scope: a truck left to coast an unbraked 12 percent grade up from a
//! near standstill over-revs on gravity alone, threading up through the gears
//! -- that is descent-control territory, not cruise, and it happens whether
//! cruise is off the throttle or not. These tests pin what cruise itself does:
//! at a realistic rolling resume it never redlines and charges no over-rev
//! wear, and it is off the throttle near the governor.
//!
//! # The road these run on
//!
//! Python reached a deterministic road with four `monkeypatch.setattr` calls
//! on the live trip: `speed_limit_at` (a flat 200, so the posted number never
//! caps cruise), `grade_at` (one constant), `traffic_context` (None) and, for
//! the exit cases, `ramp_speed_at`. Rust has no seam for an inherent method,
//! so [`bench_road`] builds the road that ANSWERS that way instead: a baked
//! `SpeedLimitSample` is exactly what `speed_limit_at` reads, a baked
//! `GradeSegment` is what `grade_at` reads, and an empty traffic manager with
//! the rolling bubble off is what makes `traffic_context` None. That is a
//! stronger rig than the patches were, because the whole trip is now fixed
//! rather than whatever route dispatch drew.
