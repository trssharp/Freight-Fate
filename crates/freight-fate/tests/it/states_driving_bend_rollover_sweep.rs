//! Do the assists hold the road's bends without rolling the truck? (owner
//! question, 2026-09-24). The exit assist matrix answers it for ramp curves;
//! this answers it for the mainline bends, on the curviest real roads in the
//! baked world, for every load the roll model prices differently.
//!
//! Each run starts a mile and a half before a three-mile stretch of mapped
//! bends, rolling at the limit (or under the number spoken for a bend right
//! there), and drives it through the real driving state at the shipped time
//! compression, weather clear, traffic off. Setups:
//!
//! - **Curve assistance**: the default (Balanced) assists, partial lane
//!   keeping, and a driver holding the throttle to the posted limit, or to
//!   the number curve assistance says it is slowing to while it has a bend.
//! - **All assists**: the All preset, adaptive cruise set to the limit, and
//!   the speed keeper; the driver's feet stay off the pedals.
//! - **Spoken number**: Balanced with curve assistance off. The driver obeys
//!   the number the cab speaks for each bend it calls (the load's own number
//!   where it is lower than the sign's) and any "slow to" warning, a mile an
//!   hour under, with a steady foot on the brake.
//! - **Cruise**: Balanced, adaptive cruise set to the limit.
//! - **Daring**: no speed assists (lane keeping full, so the road is steered),
//!   a full trailer, and a driver who takes each bend 10 mph over its sign.
//!
//! Every setup but Daring owes: no rollover, no freight moved by a bend (a
//! frame where the bend asks past the warning share; the driver's own
//! braking is reported but is the driver's), no trip off the pavement, no
//! bend asking more than `SHARE_CEILING` of the threshold, and none asking
//! past the warning share without a "too fast" heard first. The assisted
//! ones also owe no "too fast" warning (the assist owns the speed), no more
//! than one full application of the pedal per bend, and air above the
//! low-air warning. Daring owes a warning before any cost, and a roll only at
//! the roll model's own threshold -- the proof that this sweep can see a roll.
//!
//! `BEND_SWEEP_DUMP=1` prints every run's transcript; `BEND_SWEEP_ONLY=` a
//! substring of the stretch name narrows the roads;
//! `BEND_SWEEP_TRACE=Siskiyou/CurveAssist/Full` traces one run, twice a
//! second or with `BEND_SWEEP_EVERY=1` every frame. All need `--nocapture`.
