//! The destination approach assist, driven to real facilities all over the map.
//!
//! Owner, 2026-08-24: "destination approach assistance works on some legs and
//! not others" -- on the legs where it fails the truck is never brought to a
//! stop ready to pull in.
//!
//! The four `states_driving_facility.rs` approach-assist cases were deferred
//! on "a hands-off end-to-end drive over baked chain data". This file is that
//! drive; those four now use its rigging for their own narrower bars, and it
//! runs the same drive as a SWEEP, because the defect is precisely that one
//! destination arrives and the next one does not. Every run here pins its
//! trip seed and its weather: an unseeded delivery draws its own road and its
//! own sky, and letting dispatch's random draw decide which shape got
//! measured is what hid this.
//!
//! The driver in these runs is a player, not a ghost. They roll the ramp and
//! the city streets at the posted number, and they lift the moment the assist
//! announces it has the pedals -- from there nothing but the game touches the
//! truck, which is what "it stops me at the destination" has to mean.
