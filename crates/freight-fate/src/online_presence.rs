//! Port of `freight_fate/online_presence.py` — optional online presence: an
//! opt-in "on duty" heartbeat to orinks.net.
//!
//! This module is the *only* place that knows about the Orinks presence API.
//! Gameplay code reports the same broad [`PresenceState`] snapshots it
//! already builds for Discord Rich Presence; this service posts the latest one
//! to the live drivers board while the player is hauling, and clears it when
//! they stop. The board then shows lines like "Road Star -- Driving: Chicago to
//! Dallas -- steel coils, 45% there".
//!
//! Everything here is best-effort and non-fatal by design, mirroring
//! `discord_presence`: if the player is offline, the site is down, or the
//! feature is disabled, the game plays exactly as before. All network I/O
//! runs on a background thread and no error ever propagates into the game
//! loop.
//!
//! Privacy: the feature is off by default and only ever sends the broad
//! activity strings above, authenticated by account-issued credentials the
//! player receives once through device-code activation (see
//! `online_activation`). The driver's display name lives on the site, tied
//! to their Orinks account; the game never transmits profile names, save
//! data, or anything about the real player. Every request's User-Agent does
//! carry the game's build identity (see [`client_version`]) so the site can
//! tell which release a post came from -- moderation and bug triage data,
//! never shown publicly.

// dropped request before anyone is called gone; keep this and PRESENCE_TTL_MS
// on the server in step, and widen the server's window first, or a single lost
