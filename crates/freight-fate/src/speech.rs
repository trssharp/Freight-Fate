//! Port of `freight_fate/speech.py` — screen reader output via Prism.
//!
//! Prism is a screen reader abstraction layer that unifies NVDA, JAWS, SAPI,
//! VoiceOver, Speech Dispatcher, and many other backends behind one API. This
//! module wraps it in a small game-friendly interface that:
//!
//! * never crashes the game if speech is unavailable (silent fallback),
//! * picks the best backend that is actually usable on this machine: Prism's
//!   `acquire_best` cannot be trusted for this -- it returns the highest
//!   priority backend that already has a live cached instance (whatever the
//!   game happens to be holding), and otherwise ranks by static registry
//!   priority whether or not that screen reader is running -- so the registry
//!   is enumerated in priority order and every candidate is validated against
//!   its live `is_supported_at_runtime` check,
//! * treats Prism's `UIA` backend (the route to Narrator, via UI Automation
//!   notifications) as a gated last resort: it reports runtime support on every
//!   modern Windows whether or not anyone is listening, so it is skipped unless
//!   Narrator is actually running -- and even then it only wins when no other
//!   voice works, because the backend raises every notification with
//!   `NotificationProcessing_ImportantAll`, which Narrator queues without
//!   ever cancelling: interrupt and stop are no-ops, so menu browsing through
//!   it piles up unread items,
//! * keeps watching while the game runs: if the player switches screen readers
//!   mid-session (NVDA off, Narrator on, back to NVDA), a periodic health check
//!   re-detects the running one and reconnects speech instead of going silent,
//! * prefers `output` (speech + braille) and falls back to `speak`; with
//!   the braille-only setting on it sends every line, driving events
//!   included, to the main voice's `braille` instead and speaks nothing,
//! * can be disabled with the `FREIGHT_FATE_NO_SPEECH=1` environment variable
//!   (used by the headless test suite and CI), and forced to a specific backend
//!   with `FREIGHT_FATE_SPEECH_BACKEND=<name>` (for example `SAPI`).
//!
//! # Threading: each Prism context stays on its speech worker
//!
//! Every call on a Prism [`prism::Context`] -- construction, health checks,
//! speaking, configuring and shutdown -- happens on the worker that created
//! it. [`Speech`] is deliberately not `Send` or `Sync`. Recovery may leave an
//! old generation inside an in-flight native call while a replacement uses
//! private backend instances. After that call returns, the old worker stops
//! dispatching operations and retains its native objects until process exit.
//!
//! That one thread used to be the game loop's, which made every spoken line
//! a synchronous screen-reader/SAPI call the game waited on -- and the one
//! time such a call wedged (Shane, 2026-08-30, an event-voice interrupt at a
//! merge), the whole game froze with it, permanently. The windowed game now
//! builds [`ThreadedSpeech`] instead: the context lives on a dedicated
//! worker thread (created there, never moved), the game loop only queues
//! commands, and a wedged backend costs sentences, never the drive. The
//! headless app and the tests keep their direct sinks; nothing about
//! capture-based testing changed.
//!
//! # Shape of the port
//!
//! The one Python class becomes three things: the [`SpeechSink`] trait (what
//! `GameContext` needs from a speech object), the Prism-backed [`Speech`]
//! (`speech::live`), and the test doubles [`CaptureSpeech`] and [`NullSpeech`]
//! (`speech::capture`). The Prism calls themselves sit behind the
//! [`backend::VoiceRegistry`] / [`backend::VoiceBackend`] traits so the
//! selection logic -- `pick_backend`, the event voice, the refresh poll -- is
//! tested against fake registries exactly as `tests/test_speech_audio.py`
//! tests it against `FakeContext` and `RecordingBackend`.
