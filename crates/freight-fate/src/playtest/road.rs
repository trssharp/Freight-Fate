//! Drop into a chosen piece of road, set up the way you want to test it
//! (port of `tools/playtest_road.py`).
//!
//! Walking the menus to a specific hill, work zone, or limit drop takes
//! minutes and lands you somewhere slightly different every time. This
//! starts the real game -- real window, real speech, real input, your real
//! settings -- at a road feature you named, with the truck and cruise in the
//! state you asked for. The `departure` scenario instead begins loaded at a
//! real facility gate, so its street chain and on-ramp remain to be driven.
//! Every spoken line goes to a
//! transcript, so the session can be read afterwards.
//!
//! # Shape of the port
//!
//! The Python tool subclassed `MainMenuState` so that `App.run()`'s own
//! `MainMenuState(ctx)` handed back the staged drive the first time and the
//! real menu after -- a shim, because `run()` picked its first screen
//! itself. The Rust `App` takes that screen as
//! [`App::set_initial_state`][crate::app::App::set_initial_state], so the
//! drive is simply the state the loop starts on and there is nothing to
//! monkeypatch. Quitting to the main menu reaches the REAL menu, with its
//! working Exit, exactly as the subclass arranged.
//!
//! The search itself is read-only and runs against the world data alone --
//! no `App`, and so no window. Booting the game to run a search is what
//! opened and closed a real window on every `--scan`.
