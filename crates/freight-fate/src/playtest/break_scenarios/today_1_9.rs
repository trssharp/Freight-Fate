//! The 1.9 tester-reported fixes, driven the way the reports were written
//! (port of `tools/playtest_break_scenarios/today_1_9.py`).
//!
//! Each of these exists because a tester found something by playing badly or
//! oddly, and the fix that followed made a promise. A promise in a changelog
//! is worth what the next change leaves of it, so these drive the promise
//! rather than the code path: what does the driver end up with, and does the
//! game's own speech agree with the ledger.
