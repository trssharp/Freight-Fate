//! Headless playtest harness for transcript-backed gameplay verification
//! (port of `tests/playtest_harness.py`).
//!
//! # Shape of the port
//!
//! Python's harness was a context manager holding an `App`, with
//! `monkeypatch` swapping `ctx.say`/`ctx.say_event` for recorders. Here the
//! app is a [`TestApp`] -- the same headless rig every state test uses --
//! and the recorder is the [`CaptureSpeech`] already sitting under
//! `ctx.speech`.
//!
//! That seam is one rung LOWER than the Python harness's, and deliberately
//! so. The driving verbosity ladder's gate and the event pacer's
//! repeat/backlog handling both live *inside* `GameContext::say`/`say_event`;
//! replacing those (what the Python harness did) skipped both, so its
//! transcript showed what the game would say with no rung applied and no
//! repeat suppression running, not what a player actually hears.
//! `tools/playtest_break.py` had already moved its own rig down to
//! `ctx.speech` for exactly that reason, with a long note saying why. This
//! harness starts there.
//!
//! `self.driving` was a live reference to the state on the stack; here it is
//! a [`SharedState`] handle and [`PlaytestHarness::with_drive`] borrows the
//! [`DrivingState`] out of it. The app's own stack holds another `Rc` to the
//! same cell, so the borrow is safe for as long as the harness does not also
//! ask the app to tick the state -- which it never does, because every drive
//! entry point steps the state directly, exactly as the Python did.
