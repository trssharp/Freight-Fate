//! `GameContext.say` / `say_event` and everything they run: the speech

//!
//! Python defaults -> Rust: `say(text)` is `say_with(text, Say::new())`
//! (`interrupt=True, review=True, category=None`); `say_event(text)` is
//! `say_event_with(text, SayEvent::new())` (`interrupt=True, review=True,
//! priority=None, key=None, force=False, category=None, valid=None`). Both
//! take a plain `&str` or a `SpokenMessage` normal/terse pair through
