//! Shared rigging for tests that build a headless [`App`]: the conftest of
//! the Python suite in one place, so every later state port reuses it.
//!
//! * [`TestApp`] pins its own save directory on its OWN THREAD, so any
//!   number of them run at once without seeing each other's saves. It used
//!   to set the process-global `FREIGHT_FATE_DATA_DIR` instead, which meant
//!   holding [`env_lock`] for the whole life of the app -- and that lock,
//!   not the work, was what the suite's runtime actually was: 123.6 seconds
//!   on one thread against 117.4 on eight, twenty-seven cores idle.
//! * [`env_lock`] remains for the handful of tests that genuinely do write a
//!   process-global environment variable (`FREIGHT_FATE_ONLINE_URL`,
//!   `FREIGHT_FATE_LOG_FILE`). Those still have one environment between
//!   them and still have to queue; there are few enough that it costs
//!   nothing. Reach for a pinned root instead wherever the variable is only
//!   standing in for "this test's own directory".
//! * [`TestApp`] is `App()` under the conftest fixtures: headless drivers,
//!   an isolated data directory, the first-run online offer already seen,
//!   a `CaptureSpeech` in place of Prism, the null audio backend.
//! * [`RecordingAudio`] is the `monkeypatch.setattr(app.ctx.audio, "play",
//!   ...)` seam: an `Audio` that records `play` and `set_speech_duck`.
