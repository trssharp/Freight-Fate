//! [`GameContext`]: the shared services handed to every state (the
//! `GameContext` class of `freight_fate/app.py`), plus the state stack it
//! owns in this port.
//!
//! # Why the stack lives here
//!
//! In Python a state called `self.ctx.push_state(...)` and the new screen's
//! `enter()` spoke *immediately*, in the middle of the caller's handler; the
//! transcript tests pin that order. Rust cannot hand a state `&mut App`
//! while `App` is calling into it, so the stack is `Vec<Rc<RefCell<dyn
//! State>>>` owned by the context: a lifecycle call on any state that is not
//! currently borrowed runs at once, exactly as in Python, and the one case
//! that cannot -- `exit()` on the very state whose handler asked to be
//! popped (it is borrowed mutably for the duration of its own handler) -- is
//! queued and run the moment that handler returns ([`GameContext::run_deferred`],
//! which the app calls after every dispatch). Only that `exit` moves; every
//! `enter` and every other `exit` keeps its Python position.
//!
//! The speech delivery half (`say`, `say_event`, the ladder, the pacer, the
//! duck) is in `app::speech_delivery`.
