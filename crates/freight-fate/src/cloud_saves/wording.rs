// has no Add computer button at all now -- a computer is added by activating
// it from the game. The menu item is named as it reads while the identity
// file is still on disk (which it is, in this failure): the Online hub says

// 2026-08-14: an `invalid_achievement` refusal was told to the player as
// "check your connection", which sent them chasing their network for a
// problem that was never there). Every caller that turns an upload result
// into player-facing wording -- the background queue in `upload_slot` and
// the foreground "keep this computer's save" retry in
// `CloudSaves::resolve_keep_mine` -- must classify through the one
// table below, so a new validator code only has to be added in one place.
