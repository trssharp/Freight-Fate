//! The driving state (port of `freight_fate/states/driving.py`, the
//! "compatibility facade" that composed sixteen mixins onto `State`).
//!
//! # Shape of the port
//!
//! Python's `DrivingState` was one fat object partitioned only by file: every
//! mixin read and wrote `self.<attr>` on state owned by `__init__` or by other
//! mixins. Here it is one struct -- [`DrivingState`], every field listed and
//! grouped by the Python module that initialises or owns it -- and one
//! `impl DrivingState` block per former mixin file (`driving_controls.rs`,
//! `driving_updates.rs`, ...). There is no dynamic dispatch to preserve; the
//! mixins were namespaces.
//!
//! Three things are not fields:
//!
//! * `self.truck` and `self.weather` -- the Rust `Trip` owns its
//!   `TruckState` and `WeatherSystem`, so they are `self.trip.truck` and
//!   `self.trip.weather` ([`DrivingState::truck`] / [`DrivingState::weather`]
//!   are the short forms). Python aliased one object from two places.
//! * `self.hos` -- an alias of `profile.hos`; use
//!   [`crate::states::driving_core::hos_of`] / `hos_mut_of`.
//! * `self._radio_backend` -- built per call by
//!   [`DrivingState::with_radio_backend`].
//!
//! The `State` impl forwards to methods the mixin modules provide; until a
//! mixin lands, [`pending`] carries a temporary stub for each such method so
//! the crate builds. A mixin task deletes its stubs from `pending` as it
//! implements them and touches nothing else here.
//!
//! Submodules: `driving/init.rs` (`new`), `driving/snapshot.rs` (save and
//! resume), `driving/lifecycle.rs` (enter/exit and the facade's own
//! helpers).
