//! No-engine-brake zones: town noise ordinances around route cities (port of
//! `freight_fate/states/driving_engine_brake.py`, the `EngineBrakeZoneMixin`).
//!
//! Engine brakes are legal under federal and state law; what exists in the
//! real world is hundreds of municipal noise ordinances, posted NO ENGINE
//! BRAKE at the city limits, with exemptions for emergencies -- and the
//! legitimate use of the retarder, holding a heavy truck back on a real
//! downgrade, stays legal everywhere. Fines run roughly 100 to 500 dollars and
//! escalate for repeat offenders (LegalClarity municipal-ordinance survey,
//! 2026; e.g. Snyder, Texas ordinance 1043). The game maps those ordinances
//! onto the same urban radius that already lowers the speed limit near a route
//! city.
//!
//! A blind player cannot see the sign, so the spoken cue is the sign: the zone
//! announces itself ahead when the retarder is on, a violation warns with a
//! grace window before any money moves, and the citation names the amount and
//! the reason.

    /// miles for the same reason. Jacobs, who build the retarder, say what it
    /// is for: SUSTAINED speed control, "not a substitute for a service
    /// braking system".
    ///
    /// The truck already carries the whole of that model. `update_temps` heats
    /// the drums by the power the shoes dissipate and cools them toward
    /// ambient at a rate that rises with road speed:
    ///
    /// ```text
    ///   dT/dt = P_brake / C  -  (T - T_ambient) * k(v)
    ///   k(v)  = BRAKE_COOL_BASE_PER_S + BRAKE_COOL_SPEED_PER_S * sqrt(v)
    ///   C     = specs.brake_thermal_mass_j_per_c
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Held at a steady speed down a steady grade, the drums must absorb
    /// exactly what gravity gives them less what rolling resistance and drag
    /// already take -- which is `-resistance_force()`, the truck's own number,
    /// so no second copy of the physics is written here. That power settles
    /// the drums at
    ///
    /// ```text
    ///   T_settle = T_ambient + P_brake / (C * k(v))
    /// ```
    ///
    /// and the criterion is `T_settle >= brake_fade_onset_c()`: at or above it
    /// the drums are on a one-way trip to the temperature where they stop
    /// answering, and only the hill's length decides when they arrive. Below
    /// it they level off cooler than fade and hold the grade INDEFINITELY --
    /// ten miles or a hundred, the answer does not change. That is what makes
    /// the steady-state test the right separator rather than an energy budget:
    /// length cannot turn a grade the drums can hold into one they cannot, and
    /// GSRS says the same thing when it finds no speed reduction is warranted
    /// however long the grade runs.

    /// less up to 150 degC on worn shoes). At 80,000 lb and 55 mph the drums
    /// settle at fade on a 4.2 percent grade. The line moves with the load and

    ///   80,000 lb (36.0 t)   4.27%    4.15%    4.14%    4.20%
