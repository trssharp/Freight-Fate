//! The proactive half of curve speed assistance: a servo armed by the curve
//! call that brakes the truck down to the bend's advisory ON THE APPROACH,
//! holds it through the chain, and lets go past the commit tail.
//!
//! Until this existed the assist had one proactive move, and only under
//! adaptive cruise: cap cruise's working target to the advisory. Everything
//! else was reactive -- `update_lane` braked once the truck was already
//! inside the bend and over the number, which is after the load has started
//! moving. Cruise's own easing is a bounded ramp of its set point, so a hot
//! bend still arrived early; the speed keeper knew about street turns but
//! not mapped bends; a manual driver got the words and nothing else. The
//! owner drove US-83 near Junction, Texas, with every assist on, and cruise
//! carried the truck into a 35 mph bend at 90 km/h: "Sharp left: too fast,
//! drifting to the outside", and the load shifted 12, then 31 percent over
//! two bends (2026-09-01). Ruling that night: assists should handle curves
//! better to avoid load shifting damage.
//!
//! The target is the advisory itself, not the advisory plus a margin -- or
//! less, where the bend would cost this load something at its advisory. The
//! freight starts moving, and the rollover ladder starts, at the share of the
//! load's own rollover threshold a posted advisory asks of a full trailer
//! (`ROLL_WARN_SHARE`); a bend whose sign rounds up, or a part-filled tank,
//! is held under that instead (`driving_rollover::curve_safe_mph`, applied
//! where the chain is armed). A chain's tightest number wins, exactly as
//! cruise's easing cap already reasons (Darren's NY-12 pair, 2026-08-23).
//!
//! The controller is the arrival assist's, not a new one: the uniform shed
//! `(v^2 - t^2) / 2d`, net of what the road already takes off, mapped onto
//! the pedal by `arrival_servo_brake`, which rises the instant the demand
//! does and releases only when the fall is worth an application. The brake
//! is applied by `max`, so a driver braking harder is never fought, and the
//! throttle is never touched. Their own brake key cancels the servo for the
//! bend, as it cancels every other assist.
