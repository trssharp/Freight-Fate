//! Shared lifecycle helpers for the driving state's speed controllers (port
//! of `freight_fate/states/driving_speed_control.py`, the
//! `SpeedControlStateMixin`).
//!
//! `driving_events::cruise` engages and works the two controllers; this is the
//! session around them -- arming, pausing at a stop, resuming, cancelling --
//! plus the look-ahead the speed keeper eases on.
//!
//! The eight `KEEPER_SNUB_*` / `KEEPER_OVERRUN_*` / `KEEPER_EASE_UNDERSHOOT`
//! constants still live in `driving_events::pending`, where they landed first
//! and where the cruise loop imports them; they are re-exported here so this
//! module's own surface reads like the Python file's.
