//! The exit ramp past the gore, piece by piece: the deceleration lane where
//! the truck sheds to the exit speed, the ramp curve that speed is for, and
//! the run down to the stop bar.
//!
//! Realistic exit redesign, owner-approved 2026-09-24. A deceleration lane
//! is a full lane beside the through lanes and exists so a driver leaves at
//! road speed and sheds inside it: the Green Book sizes it assuming no
//! deceleration in the through lanes, and TxDOT's manual says to assume all
//! of it happens in the speed-change lane. So the exit's braking lives HERE,
//! and the exit speed (the ramp's advisory, MUTCD W13-2, which stands along
//! this lane) governs the curve that follows it, not the gore.
