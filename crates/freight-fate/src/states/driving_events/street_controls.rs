//! The lights and signs on a facility's streets.
//!
//! The street bake reads the signals, stop signs, all-way stops and yields OSM
//! maps at each intersection a chain passes (`Trip::street_controls_between`).
//! Each is played through the ramp terminal's own machinery, not a copy of
//! it: the light's fixed-time cycle and its spoken phases, the cross-traffic
//! bubble, the stop bar's countdown and tick, the stop and yield rules,
//! route-transition assistance braking for a red or a sign and holding the
//! stop, and facility stopping assistance driving on from it with the speed
//! keeper. The two files that own all that (`ramp_terminal.rs`,
//! `ramp_crossing.rs`) read the live stop bar through `terminal_gap_mi`, and
//! this file puts a street's bar there.
//!
//! What differs on a street is only what a ramp terminal always is and a
//! street intersection is not: a turn. A green is driven at the street's own
//! speed, not rolled at the ramp's twenty, and crossing it says nothing; a
//! corner at a control keeps its own call and its own speed. An intersection
//! OSM holds no control for has none here -- unknown, never rolled for.
