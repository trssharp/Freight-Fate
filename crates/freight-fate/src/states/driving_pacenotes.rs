//! Spoken curve calls -- the co-driver reads the road ahead (port of
//! `freight_fate/states/driving_pacenotes.py`, the `DrivingPacenoteMixin`).
//!
//! The first audible slice of the steering-by-ear design (see
//! docs/steering-sound-rfc.md): plain-language pacenotes from the baked
//! curve geometry, called early enough to brake before the bend, and only
//! when the bend actually demands slowing at the truck's current speed. A
//! gentle sweep taken at a legal speed stays silent -- the road only speaks
//! when it has something to say.
//!
//! Grammar: "Sharp left, half a mile. Advise 35." Severity comes from the
//! baked advisory speed (the number a posted yellow diamond would show);
//! the advisory sentence is included only when the truck is above it.
//! Curves that follow within a breath get a linked tail: "then right."
