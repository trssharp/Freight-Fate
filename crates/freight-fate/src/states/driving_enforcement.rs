//! The enforcement watch: hearing the police, and being seen by them (port of
//! `freight_fate/states/driving_enforcement.py`, the `EnforcementWatchMixin`).
//!
//! This is the game-layer half of the presence model. `sim/enforcement_posts`
//! decides where the posts are and who is sitting in them;
//! `sim/enforcement_observe` decides what one of them notices and how sure it
//! is. This module assembles what the truck is doing into a sample, plays the
//! cues, makes the named seeded draw, and hands a confirmed observation to the
//! pull-over machinery that already exists.
//!
//! Three rules shape everything here.
//!
//! **Audible before it can bite.** A staffed post cannot observe a driver who
//! was never told it was there. That is not balance, it is the whole
//! accessibility contract: a blind player cannot see a cruiser on a crossover,
//! so if the game never made a sound about it, the ticket it writes is
//! arbitrary. Every staffed post emits its marker earcon before it enters
//! observing range, and `observe` refuses to look at a driver who has not
//! heard it. An UNSTAFFED post makes no sound at all: a cue you cannot tell
//! from a staffed one, for a car nobody is sitting in, is what taught players
//! the police do not enforce.
//!
//! **Speech is rationed; earcons are not.** Two spoken enforcement lines for a
//! whole run, spent on the things that cost money -- an open scale, and
//! anything that has already taken something from you. The marked-unit pass is
//! never spoken: it is a fact about the world with no action attached, and
//! narrating it twelve times a run is pure noise. A closed scale is never
//! spoken either; the ambience swells, nothing is said, and the absence of
//! speech is what says "closed".
//!
//! **One demand at a time.** Nothing here fires while a hazard deadline is
//! running, during a microsleep, on a ramp, inside an arrival gate sequence, or
//! during a stop already in progress. Deferred, never dropped: the post keeps
//! watching, and the moment the cab is quiet again it gets its look.
//!
//! Submodules: [`cues`] (the earcons, the tableau, the scale bed), [`scales`]
//! (weigh stations, their guidance and their screening), [`watch`] (the siren
//! hold, the road sample, and the per-frame draw).
