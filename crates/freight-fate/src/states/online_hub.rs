//! The Online menu: every online feature in one place on the main menu
//! (port of `freight_fate/states/online_hub.py`).
//!
//! These items used to live in Settings under an Online category, which buried
//! actions a player reaches for by name -- "restore my save on this new
//! computer", "who is hauling right now" -- behind a settings hunt. The hub
//! keeps each consent toggle next to the account item that gives it meaning,
//! and the drivers board sits first because viewing it shares nothing.
//!
//! Toggles keep the Settings adjust model (Enter or Right changes forward,
//! Left changes backward) so nothing moves under a player's fingers; action
//! rows ignore Left and Right the same way the old category did.
