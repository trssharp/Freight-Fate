//! The per-frame heart of the drive (port of
//! `freight_fate/states/driving_updates.py`, the `DrivingUpdateMixin`).
//!
//! One `impl DrivingState` block per section of the Python file:
//!
//! * [`frame`] -- `update()` itself, the frame loop every other block hangs
//!   off, plus the safety-call re-speak and the retarder transcript trace.
//! * [`air`] -- held inputs turned into pedals: the air-brake lockout, the
//!   air/spring-brake announcements, the reverse gesture, the over-rev
//!   warning, the horn's protection valve, and the idle settle a menu needs.
//! * [`fatigue`] -- the HOS shift clock, fatigue accrual, and microsleeps.
//! * [`lanes`] -- discrete lanes: the drift model's frame, tap changes,
//!   crossings, a road that narrows under the truck, coned-off lanes and
//!   keep-right pressure.
//! * [`cues`] -- what the lane sounds like: the edge ladder, off-pavement
//!   transitions, the curve run's verdict, the transverse strips, the
//!   locator and steering tocks, and the guidance director.
//! * [`engine_audio`] -- the engine bed, the shift duck, road joints, the
//!   jake growl, the air-fill loop, and automatic retarder management.
//! * [`radio`] -- reception, the FM fringe, station rotation and personal
//!   playlists, the dial keys, and the live-data source syncs.
//! * [`hazards`] -- the braking budget, automatic emergency braking, hazard
//!   resolution, and the grade advisory.
//! * [`enforcement`] -- the dash overspeed alert, the pull-over and its
//!   compliance tracker, weigh stations, and the run-from-the-stop opt-in.
//! * [`conditions`] -- hot brakes, the destination approach assist, traction
//!   states and the chain law.
//!
//! [`pending`] is this task's TEMPORARY stub surface: every method
//! `driving_updates.py` called on a mixin that has not been ported yet. Each
//! block names the module that owns it; that module's task deletes its block
//! when it lands.
