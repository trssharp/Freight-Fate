//! Everywhere a drive stops and a menu takes over: route stops and their
//! fuel island, the loyalty desk, a full lot, the emergency shoulder, and
//! the three roadside enforcement outcomes (port of
//! `freight_fate/states/driving_rest_states.py`).
//!
//! # Python's two mixins
//!
//! * `_FuelPumpMixin` -- shared by `RestStopState` and `ParkingFullState`,
//!   because a lot filling up does not lock the pumps -- is the
//!   [`fuel_pump::FuelPump`] trait: four small accessors from the screen, the
//!   label, the purchase and the save as provided methods.
//! * `_RoadsideExitMixin` -- shared by the traffic stop and the enforcement
//!   stop -- is the [`roadside::RoadsideExit`] trait, same shape: the exit
//!   row, the suspended-exit wording, and closing the run out from the
//!   shoulder.
//!
//! Neither is a "mixin" in any Rust sense: a trait with provided methods and
//! no state, which is exactly what those two classes were.
