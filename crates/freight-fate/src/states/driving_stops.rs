//! Where the stop cues live, derived from what the truck can actually do
//! (port of `freight_fate/states/driving_stops.py`).
//!
//! Every stop cue in the game used to be a fixed distance: the stop-bar tick
//! started at three hundred feet, the held tone began at sixty, and the
//! route-transition assist mapped its pedal against a nominal three metres per
//! second squared. Those numbers were right for a dry van on level tarmac and
//! quietly wrong for everything else -- hot brakes, worn shoes, ice, a
//! downgrade, a partly filled tank running forward under braking.
//!
//! That mattered more here than it would in a game you can look at. A blind
//! driver's entire model of *where do I stop* is the tick's rate accelerating
//! from one and a tenth seconds to a seventh of a second. Leave the range fixed
//! and the cue says exactly what it has always said while the truck needs half
//! as much road again -- so the driver does precisely what the instrument told
//! them and puts the tractor into the intersection. That is not difficulty. It
//! is an ambush built into the game's most trusted affordance.
//!
//! So the geometry is computed from `sim::vehicle`'s stopping distance instead,
//! which already knows about fade, wear, load, grip and grade, and now about
//! liquid surge as well. Every original constant survives as a floor: a truck
//! that can stop shorter than the old numbers hears the bar exactly where it
//! always did, and nothing changes for the freight that was already fine.
