//! Menus for the orinks.net drivers board: setup flow and the live list
//! (port of `freight_fate/states/online_states.py`).
//!
//! Setup uses the device-code activation flow (see `online_activation`):
//! the game asks orinks.net for a short activation code, speaks it, and the
//! player enters that code in any browser on any device -- no clipboard paste
//! between the two apps. The game polls in the background and adopts the
//! resulting driver identity once the code is claimed. Nothing is transmitted
//! until a code is claimed, and the spoken disclosure below tells the player
//! exactly what sharing will send.
//!
//! All network calls run on daemon threads; the menu states poll a small
//! result slot ([`Mailbox`]) from `update` so the game loop and speech stay
//! responsive throughout. Every state carries a `threaded` switch so tests
//! run the same worker inline against a fake transport.

publish your real name, full save, coordinates, active cargo details, or precise \
