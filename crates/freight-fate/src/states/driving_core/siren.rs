//! The held siren, and the synthesized signature that leads it (port of
//! `freight_fate/states/driving_siren.py`). It lives in the driving prelude
//! because `DrivingState` owns a [`SirenLoop`] from construction; the
//! `driving_siren` module re-exports it.
//!
//! Two accessibility failures live here, and this module is both fixes.
//!
//! **The siren was a single shot.** `events/police_siren` played once, mono,
//! dead centre, at a fixed level, and never repeated -- and `_update_pull_over`
//! contained no audio at all. A player who missed that one wail had no ongoing
//! evidence a cruiser was behind them at any point in the entire stop. The siren
//! is now a held loop on its own reserved channel, panned and levelled to track
//! the cruiser as a real object. **The rise in level over the first few seconds
//! is the "he is coming up behind you" information**, and it is the single most
//! important cue in the whole enforcement system: a fixed-level siren says a
//! police car exists, a rising one says it is closing on you.
//!
//! **The radio made sirens ambiguous.** The station catalog ships around
//! thirty-eight always-available police and fire scanner streams, and nothing
//! ducked the radio for anything. A siren in the headphones could equally be the
//! programme. So enforcement leads with a signature the game synthesizes here:
//! two dry, hard-gated sine tones, no room, no noise floor, no codec artifacts.
//! That is not a claim that nothing could ever imitate it -- a station can in
//! principle broadcast anything. It is a shape that survives being heard against
//! programme material, and it is always played into a ducked radio (see
//! `_radio_cue_duck`), so it lands in a hole rather than on top of a mix. For a
//! pull-over the radio is CUT outright rather than ducked: the sudden silence is
//! itself an unambiguous cue that something has taken over the cab.
//!
//! The realistic siren stays layered underneath the signature. The signature says
//! "this is the game talking to you about enforcement"; the siren says what it is.
