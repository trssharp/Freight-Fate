//! Damage bands while driving: reduced power, limp mode, and out of service
//! (port of `freight_fate/states/driving_damage.py`, the `DamageBandMixin`).
//!
//! Damage used to be a number that cost money at the garage and shaved a
//! little power off a curve. A truck at 99 percent drove very nearly like a
//! healthy one, which is the wrong lesson twice over: an electronic engine
//! meets a serious fault with a staged inducement, and a truck past a certain
//! state of repair is not merely slow -- under the CVSA out-of-service
//! criteria it is an imminent hazard and is legally prohibited from operating
//! at all.
//!
//! So the ladder has four rungs, and the last one is a wall:
//!
//! * **reduced power** -- the engine holds back and burns more for the work.
//! * **limp mode** -- that, plus a road-speed cap the driver cannot drive out
//!   of.
//! * **the last call** -- an advisory that names the number which stops the
//!   truck.
//! * **out of service** -- the truck may not be driven. It may still crawl
//!   clear of a live lane, because leaving a stricken truck stopped in traffic
//!   is the more dangerous rule, but the run does not continue under its own
//!   power.
//!
//! The bands and every physical consequence live in `sim/vehicle`
//! (`damage_band`, `damage_derate_factor`, `speed_cap_mph`, `out_of_service`)
//! so the model layer stays the single source of truth and nothing here is
//! spoken flavour over unchanged physics. This module is the game layer around
//! them: what the driver hears at each edge, how the cap winds in, and what
//! recovery costs.
//!
//! Three rules shape the spoken side, all of them existing house rules:
//!
//! * **Speak first, then bite.** Crossing a band announces the cap and opens
//!   it at the speed the truck already has, then winds it down at about 2 mph
//!   per second -- the same comfortable-braking figure the dropped-speed-limit
//!   grace uses. A cap that snapped would take the road away mid-sentence.
//! * **Both edges, both verbosities.** Every band speaks once when it begins
//!   and again when a repair drops back out of it, terse included. Without the
//!   downward edge a player cannot tell whether a repair cleared limp mode.
//! * **Band before number.** A warning leads with the band; a status readout
//!   gives both, so the number and its meaning never travel separately.
//!
//! Recovery copies the out-of-fuel roadside rescue: not offered, not
//! refusable, real money and real game time. Who pays is where the two
//! business statuses part company, and they part sharply -- see
//! [`DrivingState::recover_out_of_service`].
