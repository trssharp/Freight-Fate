//! Rollover in the cab: the warning before a bend costs anything, and what
//! going over does to the run.
//!
//! The physics is `ff_core::sim::vehicle` (`roll.rs`): one sideways pull
//! against one threshold, for a mapped bend and an exit ramp's curve alike.
//! This is the game layer around it.
//!
//! **The warning comes before the cost.** A bend starts costing the truck at
//! the first of two speeds: where the load starts working against its straps
//! (the roll model's warning share of this load's threshold) and, with the
//! lane work the driver's, where the tires can no longer hold the lane and the
//! truck runs wide. The warning names that speed and fires while slowing to
//! it is still possible -- inside the bend at once, or on the approach once
//! the road left is no more than the truck needs to shed to it. It used to be
//! a flat 15 mph over the sign, and a hot ramp curve could cost the load and
//! put the truck on the shoulder with nothing said (agent drive, 2026-09-24:
//! 47 into a 35 ramp curve, partial lane keeping, cargo already moving).
//!
//! **Going over reuses the catastrophic path the game already has.** Damage
//! runs to the out-of-service wall and the freight to scrap, the truck is
//! stopped where it lies, and `recover_out_of_service` does what it does for
//! any truck that may not be driven: road service and the bill for an owner-
//! operator, a grounded tractor and a yard spare for a company driver. The
//! receiver refuses the load at the dock, as it refuses any load in that state.
