//! Route events, exits and ramps, the destination approach, cruise and the
//! speed keeper's spoken half (port of
//! `freight_fate/states/driving_events.py`, the `DrivingEventMixin`).
//!
//! The Python mixin was one 5,500-line class body; here it is one
//! `impl DrivingState` block per section, split by what each section is
//! about:
//!
//! * [`ambient`] -- the ambient line queue (`_speak_ambient_event` and the
//!   drain that ages lines out rather than performing them late).
//! * [`trip_events`] -- `_handle_trip_event` and everything that decides
//!   whether a trip event speaks, in what category, at what priority.
//! * [`stops`] -- the rest key (`T`), the selected sleep stop, and opening a
//!   route point's menu.
//! * [`exits`] -- the exit signal (`X`), the exit lane, the countdown, and
//!   the exit speed assist; [`destination_exit`] is the delivery's own exit:
//!   the interchange scan, its name, and its announcement.
//! * [`chains`] -- the facility street chains: surface (arrival) and
//!   departure, plus the acceleration lane that ends the departure one.
//! * [`ramp_terminal`] -- what meets you at the end of a ramp: the light,
//!   the sign, the cross-traffic bubble, the stop bar and its tone;
//!   [`ramp_crossing`] works the pedals for it and judges the crossing.
//!   [`street_controls`] plays a facility chain's lights and signs through
//!   the same two.
//! * [`update_exit`] -- the per-frame advance of an armed exit or an active
//!   ramp, and the destination terminal loop-back.
//! * [`cruise`] -- arming and adjusting cruise and the speed keeper;
//!   [`cruise_loop`] is the per-frame loop, its caps and its grade preview.
//! * [`arrival`] -- the gate, the missed destination exit, the dock menu,
//!   and the state's `lines()` / presence.
//!
//! [`pending`] is this task's TEMPORARY stub surface: every method and free
//! function `driving_events.py` called on a mixin that has not been ported
//! yet. Each block names the module that owns it; that module's task deletes
//! its block here when it lands its real implementation.
