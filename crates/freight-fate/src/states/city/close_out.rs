//! Closing out a career that is over: the player's own act of removing the
//! save from this computer and its backups from the cloud.
//!
//! A lifetime disqualification ends the driving, not the data. The game never
//! deletes a career on its own: a mis-held key or a bug in the one code path
//! that reaches the disqualification would otherwise destroy a career with no
//! way back, and the real record outlives a real disqualification by decades.
//! So the terminal offers this screen, only to a career that is over, last on
//! the menu, behind a confirmation that says exactly what goes and what stays.
//!
//! The cloud half runs on a worker thread like every other cloud call; the
//! screen waits for its answer before touching the local file, so the player
//! hears one outcome that covers both. A computer with no cloud sign-in
//! removes the local save and says the cloud was never involved.
