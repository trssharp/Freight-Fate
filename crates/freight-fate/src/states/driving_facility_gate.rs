//! Missing the facility gate: too fast past the entrance means a loop-back
//! (port of `freight_fate/states/driving_facility_gate.py`, the
//! `FacilityGateMixin`).
//!
//! The destination facility's gate ends the drive, and the trip model clamps the
//! odometer there -- which used to be an invisible treadmill: cross the gate at
//! highway speed and the miles simply stopped while the truck barreled on, no
//! overshoot, no consequence. A truck that crosses the gate above the gate
//! zone's own posted limit (`FACILITY_GATE_LIMIT_MPH`, the 15 the last half
//! mile is signed at) has missed the entrance.
//!
//! The miss is the third instance of an existing pattern -- the blown ramp stop
//! and the missed destination exit both loop back -- and reuses its idioms: a
//! scripted reposition through the next safe turnaround, game time charged, and
//! the gate ahead again. The spoken cue is the only signage, so a pre-gate speed
//! warning with an explicit target speed always precedes the first possible
//! miss, and a real-time reaction window (`ramp_arrival_grace_seconds`, the
//! same rule the ramp uses) must expire before one latches -- under time
//! compression a distance alone is unbeatable. HOS, the clock, and fuel keep
//! running through every loop; the lost time is the consequence, never a fine.
