//! Street corners cost speed, not reflex: be under the turn speed or loop back
//! (port of `freight_fate/states/driving_turns.py`, the `TurnCommitmentMixin`).
//!
//! The sim carries no heading or yaw -- `LaneKeeping` has a lateral offset and
//! a discrete lane index and nothing else -- so a "manual turn" could only ever
//! have been a reaction-window quick-time event. That version was built and
//! withdrawn (2026-07-15) because a timed snap excludes players with slow
//! reaction or motor impairments. The owner's replacement is commitment, not
//! reflex: a corner is a speed you have to be under by the time you reach it,
//! announced far enough out to brake by ear, exactly the way the exit ramp
//! already demands `RAMP_MAX_MPH` and the facility gate demands
//! `FACILITY_GATE_LIMIT_MPH`. Braking to a spoken number is plannable; snapping
//! an arrow inside a second and a half is not.
//!
//! The turn speed is anchored to the road, never invented: the street the truck
//! is turning ONTO carries a baked `local_speed_mph` (25 named, 15 unnamed
//! service ways), and the CORNER's own speed comes from its measured turn angle
//! through `ff_core::data::corners` -- TxDOT's design radius for that angle,
//! priced at the lateral a loaded combination actually holds. A square city
//! corner lands a little over 9 mph, a sweeping 60-degree one near 12, a
//! switchback under 8, and the advisory is the lower of that and the street.
//!
//! Until 2026-09-18 both ends were assumed constants instead -- the street
//! limit clamped between 15 and 20 -- so every corner in the game got the same
//! answer, and a truck already held at 14-15 by the speed keeper was under all
//! of them and never heard an advisory at all. `docs/turn-geometry-brief.md`
//! is the standing record of that directive and the sources behind the model.
//!
//! The miss is the fourth instance of the shipped loop-back pattern (blown ramp
//! stop, missed destination exit, missed facility gate) and inherits the two
//! lessons that cost the most to learn:
//!
//! - Drop back a FULL SPOKEN WINDOW, never a fixed distance. Under time
//!   compression a fixed stretch passes before it can be heard, so the retry is
//!   unwinnable.
//! - RESET EVERY say-once latch on the reposition, including the trip's own
//!   navigation announcements. When the missed-exit loop did not, the second
//!   miss stranded the trip.
//!
//! Escalation ships on day one, because a loop with no escalation is a route
//! that can stop being finishable: the core sentence is identical every time so
//! the flow stays predictable by ear, help is appended from the second miss, and
//! the corner is completed for the player -- with the time still charged --
//! either on a repeat miss of the SAME corner or on the third miss anywhere.
//!
//! Highway junctions are deliberately not judged here. Their cues carry no
//! direction, radius, or lane ordinal, and `docs/nav-phrasing-brief.md` forbids
//! speaking a lane ordinal that was never harvested.
