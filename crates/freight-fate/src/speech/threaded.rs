//! The speech worker: Prism on its own thread, so a wedged screen-reader
//! call can never freeze the game.
//!
//! # Why
//!
//! Every spoken line used to be a synchronous Prism/SAPI call on the main
//! game loop. The one time that call did not return -- tester Shane,
//! 2026-08-30, an event-voice interrupt at an I-77 on-ramp -- the whole
//! game froze with it, silently and permanently: the log's last line is
//! the transcript entry written immediately before `say_event`, and the
//! only thing left to do was kill the process. A screen reader or SAPI
//! wedging is outside this game's control; the game staying drivable
//! through it is not.
//!
//! # The threading invariant, kept
//!
//! Every Prism context is created and used on its own worker thread;
//! [`super::live::Speech`] stays `!Send`, and the game holds only channels.
//! Recovery abandons a generation that may still be inside a native call.
//! Once that call returns, it cannot dispatch further operations. Its native
//! objects are retained until process exit, since even release may wedge.
//!
//! # Semantics preserved
//!
//! Commands are processed strictly in send order by one worker, so the
//! relative order of says, interrupts, and stops is exactly what it was.
//! What changes is who waits: nobody. If the backend wedges, the queue
//! bounds itself (a full queue drops new SAY lines -- the transcript and
//! review log already have them from the main side -- and never grows),
//! the watchdog in [`ThreadedSpeech::poll`] says so once in the log, and
//! the game keeps driving on earcons until the backend comes back.
//!
//! The two calls that genuinely need an answer (`refresh`,
//! `say_adjustment_preview`) wait a BOUNDED couple of seconds and answer
//! pessimistically on timeout -- a settings-menu hiccup, never a freeze.
//!
//! # Respawn
//!
//! A wedge that never clears used to cost speech for the rest of the
//! session: tester Chris, 2026-09-03, pressed Control to stop the road
//! voice mid-sentence, the SAPI purge under it never returned, and both
//! voices were gone for the remaining half hour of the drive (NVDA itself
//! stayed fine -- it had just spoken the game's previous line). Now, once
//! the heartbeat has been stale for [`RESPAWN_AFTER_S`], the watchdog
//! abandons the stuck worker and starts a replacement on FRESH backend
//! instances ([`super::live::Speech::new_after_wedge`]): Prism caches one
//! instance per backend across contexts, so a replacement that re-acquired
//! SAPI would block on the same stuck voice. The player's speech settings
//! are replayed to the new worker before readiness is acknowledged, and the log reads "stopped responding",
//! "abandoned ... replacement", "recovered". Bounded to [`MAX_RESPAWNS`]
//! per session so a backend that wedges on every line cannot spawn threads
//! forever. Verified against Prism 0.18.2 before building (a second
//! context speaks while the first is alive, a created SAPI instance is idle
//! while the cached one is mid-utterance, and the replacement outlives the
//! abandoned context's eventual shutdown).
