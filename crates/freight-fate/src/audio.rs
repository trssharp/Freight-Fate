//! Runtime audio engine: sound effects, loops, engine audio, and music.
//!
//! Port of `freight_fate/audio.py`. Two interchangeable backends sit behind
//! the [`AudioEngine`] facade:
//!
//! * **BASS** ([`BassBackend`]) -- the preferred backend. The truck engine is
//!   a multisample ring: one real cab loop per rpm band, crossfaded
//!   equal-power with per-band playback-rate tracking (BASS attribute
//!   slides). When the licensed cuts are absent it falls back to the single
//!   idle loop pitched up with RPM. With no audio device (headless CI) it
//!   initializes BASS's "no sound" device, so the full code path still runs
//!   silently.
//! * **null** ([`NullBackend`]) -- every primitive a no-op, so game logic
//!   never needs to check for audio availability. The Python build had a
//!   pygame.mixer fallback between the two; the Rust build does not ship
//!   pygame, so `FREIGHT_FATE_AUDIO_BACKEND=pygame` lands here.
//!
//! The facade's public surface is the [`Audio`] trait: what the rest of the
//! game calls, and what a test double implements. Python default arguments
//! became explicit `_with` variants -- `play(key)` is `play_with(key, 1.0,
//! 0.0)`, `stop_loop(channel)` is `stop_loop_with(channel, 300)`, and so on;
//! every short form is a provided method that applies the Python default.
//! `set_volumes(master=.., sfx=..)` takes a [`VolumeUpdate`] whose `None`
//! fields are the omitted keywords.
//!
//! Sound keys are paths relative to the bundled sound library, without
//! extension: `play("ui/menu_select")` plays
//! `freight_fate/assets/sounds/ui/menu_select.ogg` (or its packed twin).
