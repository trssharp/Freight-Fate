//! Port of `freight_fate/cloud_saves.py` — optional cloud save backup:
//! careers mirrored to the player's Orinks account.
//!
//! This module is the *only* place that knows about the Orinks cloud save API.
//! After each local save the game hands the profile snapshot to
//! [`CloudSaves`], which uploads it (debounced, on a background thread) to
//! a revisioned slot on orinks.net under the same account-issued Driver ID and
//! token the drivers board already uses -- the player never handles a second
//! credential. Restores and conflict choices run through the Cloud backup menu
//! (the `cloud_save_states`).
//!
//! Everything here is best-effort and non-fatal by design, mirroring
//! `online_presence`: if the player is offline, the site is down, or the
//! feature is disabled, the game saves locally exactly as before. No error
//! ever propagates into the game loop.
//!
//! Sync model: last-write-wins with a conflict guard. Every upload names the
//! cloud revision it was based on; if another machine advanced the slot in the
//! meantime the server answers 409 and nothing is overwritten -- the slot is
//! marked conflicted here and the Cloud backup menu offers a spoken choice
//! between the two copies.
//!
//! Privacy: off by default and separate from public Profile sharing. Backups are
//! private to the player's own orinks.net account; only an allowlisted summary of the
//! latest accepted revision can supply detailed public statistics when Profile
//! sharing is independently enabled.
//!
//! The uploaded content is the profile JSON *without* the local HMAC signature
//! fields: the signing secret is per-machine. orinks.net validates that portable
//! payload before accepting a revision and signs it with Ed25519. Downloads are
//! hash-checked and signature-verified before any local file is touched; a
//! successful restore is immediately HMAC-signed for this installation.
//!
//! `Profile` lives outside this crate: the service takes profile snapshots as
//! JSON values, and [`restore_to_disk`] writes through the caller's hooks.
