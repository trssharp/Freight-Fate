//! `--agent-server`: an MCP server inside the real game, so an AI agent can
//! play Freight Fate the way a player does -- keys in, ears out.
//!
//! This is deliberately NOT built on the headless playtest harness. The
//! harness runs the game's own states, but not the game's own runtime: it
//! fakes the pacer clock, records audio instead of running BASS, captures
//! speech instead of speaking, and never executes the real startup path --
//! which is exactly where bugs like the deaf-for-sixteen-seconds menu live.
//! Here the agent connects to the game itself: the real window loop, real
//! wall-clock time, real audio engine, real speech through Prism (audible on
//! the operator's screen reader, so you can listen to your agent play), and
//! the real menus from the title screen on. Nothing is staged for it; it
//! presses New career like anyone else.
//!
//! The agent's capabilities are a player's, enforced by the same seam the
//! autonomous road observer uses: inputs go through
//! [`PlayerInputFrame::queue_player_input`], which "cannot bypass input
//! dispatch or drive physics", and observation is what came out of the
//! speakers -- both channels of speech, plus every earcon, cue, loop, and
//! engine pitch move, because quiet mode exists precisely so that sound
//! carries what speech does not. One inspector tool (`observe`) exposes the
//! same bounded [`DrivingObservation`] snapshot the observer gets, labeled
//! as ground truth rather than ears: an agent that NEEDS it to drive has
//! found an accessibility gap, and that is a finding.
//!
//! The session always runs in the playtest sandbox (prepared and audited by
//! the same code as `--playtest-sandbox`), so an agent can never touch the
//! operator's real careers, settings, or keyring. `SingleInstanceGuard`
//! still applies: one game at a time, agent or human.
//!
//! Transport: newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio (the MCP stdio
//! transport). Stdout carries protocol messages only; everything else this
//! mode prints goes to stderr.
//!
//! The handshake needs no game. An MCP client spawns every server it knows
//! at startup just to ask for the tool list -- Claude Code does it for each
//! session in this repo -- and the first shipped server booted the real
//! game before it read a byte of stdin, so enabling it launched a game
//! window into every session and held the one-game-at-a-time lock against
//! the owner (found live, 2026-09-01). Now `initialize`, `tools/list` and
//! `ping` are answered from the serve thread alone; the sandbox, the lock,
//! the window, audio and speech all wait for the first play request, and a
//! client that hangs up takes the game down with it.
