# Freight Fate Roadmap

> **RELEASE SCOPE (amended 2026-07-27, owner + Josh):** the 1.9 line
> takes FIXES plus exactly the final slate Josh named -- (1) the easy
> multilane slice (wiring the already-baked lane counts into speech),
> (2) curve navigation with steering, (3) rumble strips (one system
> with curve nav), (4) the engine-ring spectra rebuild, and (5) the
> NPR translator radio batch. Nothing else: every other unchecked
> FEATURE bullet below targets the `feat/career-2.0` line, except the
> explicitly scoped 1.10 work below (2.0 worktree
> `.claude/worktrees/career-2.0`, created 2026-08-18; the `C:/dev/ff-2.0`
> path this note used to name never existed). The driving school stays
> gated off 1.9 (`DRIVING_SCHOOL_ENABLED`) and reopens on 2.0 to be
> finished.
> Track plan: `docs/plan-1.9-final-slate.md`.

> On September 11, the owner approved five corrections to existing 1.9 systems:
> commercial bobtail duty, braking estimates, component service limits, fuel
> weight, and reachable HOS rest stops. The weekly HOS cycle and full personal
> conveyance controls remain in the 1.10 plan.

> Current stable: **1.8.8.1** (hotfix shipped 2026-08-08). Next release: **1.9.0**, in
> flight on the `feat/career-1.9` branch -- driving realism between the exits
> (discrete lanes, ramp terminals, congestion, real surface streets) plus the
> highway-spider world expansion, roadside narration, and real time zones.
> `pyproject` is set to 1.9.0 so developer snapshots report it; the stable tag
> follows at release. Keep this file current: when a feature lands on the 1.9
> line, check it off here in the same change.

## Reading this roadmap

Start with the [1.9 release gate](#release-gate----what-stands-between-here-and-a-public-190),
including its cutover checklist, remaining bugs, and owner decisions.
The [1.10 plan](#110-planned----the-working-week-and-home) follows it.
The [detailed roadmap](docs/roadmap-details.md) preserves the implementation
record and full pending backlog. Section links below keep existing roadmap
bookmarks usable.

## 1.9 in flight (`feat/career-1.9`)

- [ ] Validate the Windows portable snapshot on a clean Windows installation
      without a separately installed Visual C++ redistributable; the build
      runner's smoke test alone cannot establish this.

### Release gate -- what stands between here and a public 1.9.0

The checklist below retains the recorded open release gates. Verification here
covers the September 11 corrections; other items have not been revalidated. The
[detailed backlog](docs/roadmap-details.md) retains the supporting notes and
[completed gate work](docs/roadmap-details.md#completed-19-release-gate-work).

#### Release cutover checklist

These steps remain open even where a related implementation bullet is checked:

- [ ] Revert-the-revert on dev for the driving-assists withdrawal
      BEFORE the release merge (merging career-1.9 alone will NOT
      restore the assists; the bullet in the Realism and polish pass
      section spells out the exact commits). Public career selection
      re-lands the same way.
- [ ] The invariants-export regen against PRODUCTION, now including the
      credential ladder's rows ("STILL OWED AT THE DEV CUTOVER").
- [ ] The cutover replay: freshly played 1.9 careers (company new hire,
      slip-seat 4+, post-buy-in owner-operator) against the prod
      validator, not just stored blobs.
- [ ] Flip `DEFAULT_BASE_URL` back to production and drop the
      2026-08-staging key (PRE-RELEASE MUST-DO bullet).
- [ ] Convex deploys before any build with the no-transfer marker
      ships; the radio stream sweep (`--recheck-dead`) runs before the
      release; the place-callouts ladder rides the release merge to dev.
- [ ] The physical-Mac VoiceOver listening pass on the Mac release
      staging, and the owner voice pass over seven achievement titles.

#### Player-impacting release blockers

These items are part of the release-gate sweep:

- [ ] Lane centering assist is a settings promise with no feature:
      implement or retire before 1.9 ships (owner decision).
- [ ] Signal running always clips cross traffic and never draws a
      citation -- backwards both ways.
- [ ] The 2026-08-13 Dropbox tester findings are still untriaged.
- [x] Cruise switches its traffic focus on the actual held-wheel lane
      crossing, keeping the origin lane until then and protecting traffic in
      the lane entered.
- [x] Braking estimates share the live brake-force calculation. Generic
      hazard warnings retain service-braking and reaction time; emergency
      braking has its own stopping estimate.

- [ ] Testers hear sounds quieter at the quiet speech rung; three
      suspects eliminated, still unexplained.
- [ ] Departing straight into a hazard at route mile zero -- MOSTLY DONE:
      the real-zone floor and the merge-free opening miles landed
      2026-08-16; what remains is departure chains for the other 72
      percent of facilities, a data project.

#### World data and sound licensing blockers

- [ ] ~250 legs' curves/limits/ramps still describe pre-repair
      geometry (re-bake over the 210 repaired legs; finish the 250).
- [ ] 33 legs a truck router would refuse.
- [ ] 776 facility approach pins land too far out (the 35-mile
      deadhead); blanket 25-mph approach streets for miles.
- [ ] The Duff-shared sound cues flagged unlicensed by the provenance
      audit -- cannot ship in a public build (separate from the
      resolved Splice matter; owner may already know better).
- [ ] Colorado's live traffic and construction are dead (CARS GraphQL
      retired).

#### Owner decisions

These decisions remain with the owner: engine off at trip start;
the per-aid assistance-mode assessment; the two CONFIRMATION lines
silenced at quiet (2026-08-22 build); the two parked branches
(honest-brake-decel; the speech-ladder branch predates the Rust cutover
and needs triage before revival); public career following the opened
career (Shane's design ask).

The detailed backlog retains the remaining work and its recorded release scope.
Update each item where it is recorded; this reorganization does not change
its status or release decision.

### September 11 trucking corrections

- [x] Commercial bobtail repositioning records driving time while moving and
      on-duty time while stopped, including terminal turnaround.
- [x] Tires, brakes, and engine warn at the 80-percent game maintenance
      threshold and require service at 100 percent. Garage and roadside
      recovery remain available to company drivers and owner-operators.
- [x] Remaining diesel contributes to gross weight. Dispatch previews use
      the assigned tractor, and fuel menus report full-tank weight margin.
- [x] HOS advice selects a compatible reachable rest stop and warns before
      the last usable exit. Interrupted warnings retry after pause or resume;
      completed warnings stay suppressed until the relevant reset.
- [x] Skip speech voices that fail to initialize and retain spoken agent
      readouts when sound output is busy. Native SAPI and OneCore checks pass.
      A live session with normal Windows access used NVDA and SAPI, completed
      a short drive and stop, and returned status and HOS readouts without
      speech errors. The earlier initialization failure reproduced in the
      restricted shell without the agent server.
- [x] The long half of a sleeper split (7 or more berth hours) pauses the
      14-hour window while it runs, as 49 CFR 395.1(g)(1)(iii)(B) excludes
      qualifying rest from the window; the short half counts until the pair
      is credited. Tester report 2026-09-11: 7 duty hours plus an 8-hour
      berth rest woke to a closed window.
- [x] `--agent-server --operator-keys` keeps the window up and lets the
      owner's keyboard reach the game, to drive alongside the agent; the
      repo's `.mcp.json` passes it. Without the switch the keys are still
      dropped at the door.
- [ ] Complete the owner's listening pass and longer gameplay verification
      of wear thresholds and interrupted warnings. Captured live readouts and
      successful native calls do not establish what the owner heard.
- [x] Stabilized the curve-assistance test's empty-road fixture. It clears
      current vehicles and disables random traffic replenishment before the
      bend cases run. One full run reported cargo damage; focused and full
      reruns passed.
- [x] The clock key's arrival estimate on the departure streets adds the
      parked highway run at its route pace, and the speed readout names a
      lead vehicle that is setting the speed keeper's number (agent drive,
      Dallas to Sherman with every assist on, 2026-09-11).
- [x] Facility stopping assistance is a preset field again (owner ruling
      2026-09-11): Realistic off, Balanced and All assists on, hand changes
      read as Custom. The 2026-08-31 rest-stop merge had left it outside the
      presets while the manual promised Balanced stops at the destination.
- [ ] The S key names a connector arc's advisory ("The bend here advises
      40") at a highway-to-highway interchange, but connector arcs are
      excluded from the curve call, the curve servo and the cargo model by
      design, so the truck stayed at 70 through it with no cargo at risk.
      Either drop the connector from that readout or say it is the
      interchange's number, so the driver is not told about a bend no
      assist acts on (same drive, I-30 to I-35 at Fort Worth).

## 1.10 planned -- the working week and home

Design doc: `docs/eld-home-terminal-design.md`. The ELD grows from a daily
countdown into the system that shapes a driver's week, and the home
terminal becomes the anchor of that week instead of a spawn point.

- [ ] **70-hour/8-day cycle with the 34-hour restart.** A rolling on-duty
      ledger on `HosClock`, spoken through the existing ELD status line;
      restarts at the home terminal are free and full, road restarts cost
      motel money and comfort. The 1.10 centerpiece.
- [ ] **Home terminal persisted and consequential.** `home_terminal_city`
      on the profile (old saves default to the current city with a
      one-time spoken note), ELD readouts in home-terminal time,
      discounted garage work at your terminal, dispatch "gets you home"
      lane notes, and paid domicile relocation for owner-operators.
- [ ] **Local board (short-haul identity).** A second dispatch surface at
      the home terminal: short home-region runs, home every night, no
      cycle pressure, lower pay -- weighted toward new hires in the
      assigned-dispatch levels.

### Personal conveyance and duty-purpose correction

Regulatory baseline: [FMCSA personal-conveyance guidance](https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/regulations/hours-service/personal-conveyance)
and [FMCSA ELD recording guidance](https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/hours-service/elds/if-driver-permitted-use-commercial-motor-vehicle-cmv-personal-reasons-how-must).

- [x] **Commercial bobtail duty corrected in 1.9.** Driving empty to another
      city's dispatch board records driving/on-duty repositioning. Bobtail
      still means a tractor without a trailer; deadhead with an empty trailer
      remains a separate physical configuration.
- [ ] **Personal-conveyance first slice.** Add spoken Start personal
      conveyance and End personal conveyance actions to the ELD menu.
      Ask for a valid purpose and nearby destination: food, shower,
      lodging, or the nearest reasonable safe parking after a shipper or
      receiver releases the driver. Record the movement as off duty with
      a personal-conveyance annotation, reason, start and end locations,
      and distance; preserve it through save/resume.
- [ ] **Keep the clock and truck behavior honest.** Personal conveyance
      still consumes fuel, accumulates fatigue, and keeps all driving
      safety and enforcement active. It does not consume driving or
      on-duty hours, but a short move does not pause or extend an already
      running 14-hour window. Use a carrier policy distance limit rather
      than presenting it as a federal mileage rule; loaded versus empty
      is not the deciding test, though a carrier may set a stricter
      policy.
- [ ] **Reject commercial uses and handle the after-hours exception
      narrowly.** Do not permit personal conveyance to approach the next
      pickup, shop another dispatch board, return to a terminal after a
      dispatched trip, or travel for maintenance. Running out of hours
      alone does not qualify; the exception is leaving a shipper or
      receiver for the first reasonable safe parking location and then
      taking the required rest.
- [ ] **Make misuse reviewable.** The logbook and traffic-stop inspection
      must read the annotation and route evidence. A later enforcement
      slice can question repeated maximum-distance use or other suspicious
      patterns without turning legitimate personal trips into random
      punishment.
- [ ] **Yard moves are separate.** On-property facility movements record
      as on-duty yard time, not personal conveyance or ordinary highway
      driving.
- [ ] **Verify the complete spoken path.** Cover keyboard reachability,
      ELD start/end confirmations, logbook wording, save/resume, eligible
      and rejected destinations, HOS/fatigue behavior, and traffic-stop
      review with transcript-backed playtests. Update in-game help, the
      user manual, and the changelog when the feature lands.
- [ ] **Other ELD character events.** Daily log certification, carrier
      edit approve/reject prompts, a rare ELD-malfunction paper-log day,
      and the adverse-conditions +2-hour exception wired to live weather.

### Signalling a street turn

Deferred out of 1.9 (owner call 2026-08-10) rather than bolting a blinker
onto exit signalling.

- [ ] **A blinker for surface-street maneuvers.** X signals an announced
      highway exit and plays one panned `vehicle/signal_tone`; nothing
      signals a street corner. The map is not the blocker -- baked tier-1
      maneuvers already carry direction and distance, which is what feeds
      the `events/turn_left` and `turn_right` earcons. What is missing is
      the turn as a continuous act: `LaneKeeping` has a lateral offset and
      a lane index and no heading, the same gap that killed the quick-time
      turn in July. Needs a held tick that self-cancels at the corner and a
      rule about signalling before one, alongside whatever turn geometry
      the surface-intersection work (1.9, `docs/surface-roads-plan.md`
      phase 4) leaves behind. The self-cancel half of that now exists:
      `_update_steering_lane_cue` holds a cue on the audio clock's dead
      man's switch and ends it with a centred, quieter `vehicle/signal_tone`.
      Borrow it rather than building a second one.
- [ ] **Decide the two orphan sound assets in the same change.**
      `vehicle/turn_signal` is the repeating tick this feature wants and
      has never been wired to anything. `vehicle/lane_drift` is dead for a
      different reason -- the edge ladder took its job -- so it is a
      deletion, not a wiring job.
