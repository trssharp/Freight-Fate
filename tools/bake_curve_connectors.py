"""Re-derive every baked curve's ``connector`` flag from OSM's own road classes.

WHAT WAS WRONG
--------------
The dense sweep decides ``connector`` by POSITION: a curve within
``CONNECTOR_WINDOW_MI`` (0.75 mi) of either end of a leg is a connector, and
everything else is mainline. That window is blind to the two places
interchange geometry actually lives:

  * the middle of a leg, where the route takes a ramp from one freeway to
    another, and
  * the miles of surface street and slip road a route rides before it ever
    reaches the interstate the leg is named for -- 0.75 mi does not get a
    truck out of Denver.

So ramp arcs and city-departure kinks were baked as INTERSTATE MAINLINE, and
every consumer that reads mainline curves -- the pacenote callout, the cruise
clause, cargo damage -- treated them as bends in the road. Measured: 1,954
interstate mainline curves demanding a drop below 65 mph, one every 44.2
miles, on a road system that asks for none.

THE DISCRIMINATOR IS READ, NOT DERIVED
--------------------------------------
``tools/curve_valhalla_facts.py`` map-matches each leg's archived polyline
through Valhalla and records what edge every curve's apex rides, plus what
class of road the leg itself is made of, mile by mile. Two readings:

  ``osm:ramp``          the apex rides a ``highway=*_link`` way, which is the
                        tag OSM uses for a ramp, slip road or interchange
                        connector. True on every road class.
  ``osm:off-corridor``  the apex rides a road LESS IMPORTANT than the one its
                        leg is made of -- the town the route threads on its
                        way in or out, rather than the through road.

The comparison is what matters, and it is against the leg's own road rather
than a fixed class. An Interstate leg is made of ``motorway`` (every
Interstate mainline mile is a controlled-access freeway by statute, 23 CFR
625, and US mappers tag controlled access as ``motorway``), so only motorway
bends are its mainline. A curated I-65 leg whose route actually runs US-231
end to end is made of ``trunk``, and its trunk bends are that road's real
mainline.

WHY NOT JUST "IS IT MOTORWAY". Tried, and it fails in both directions. Gated
on the LABEL it silenced 2,677 real bends on 36 legs whose route never rides
the interstate they are named for. Turned off wholesale for those legs it
restored the real US-231 bends together with Brickell Avenue in downtown
Miami at a 38 ft radius. Comparing against the leg's own class does neither.

WHY NOT A COVERAGE PERCENTAGE. Also tried. The obvious gate is "apply the
rule only to legs that ride a freeway for more than half their miles", and
the histogram forbids it: the distribution is not bimodal, 52 interstate legs
sit between 40 and 60 percent, so any cut would sit in a crowd and would have
been chosen to look right. ``corridor_class`` is an argmax instead -- whichever
class the route spends most of its miles on -- so there is no number to tune.

Neither reading looks at radius, deflection, advisory or severity, so this
cannot tell a sharp curve from a gentle one and cannot delete a design
exception. I-70 through Glenwood Canyon is ``highway=motorway`` and reads
exactly like I-70 across Kansas.

MOUNTAIN GEOMETRY, CHECKED THE WAY THE ARTIFACT SCREEN CHECKS ITSELF. Of the
18,340 rows moved off-corridor, 1,183 are on HPMS mountainous legs, and 42 of
those turn like a switchback (135 degrees or more at an advisory of 30 or
less). Every one of the 42 is a named town street -- North Pack Square in
Asheville, Frederick Street in Cumberland, North Bartow Street, town squares
looping 260 to 368 degrees. Not one is a road switchback. Terrain alone
cannot separate a mountain town square from a mountain switchback; the road
under the bend can.

WHY NOT A RADIUS FLOOR
----------------------
Because that was tried and it deleted real road:
``INTERSTATE_MIN_RADIUS_FT`` raised to the 50 mph design minimum (758 ft)
reads correctly and takes I-70 out of Glenwood Canyon, which bends tighter
than standard under design exceptions. A screen sized to the design floor
cannot tell an exception from an artifact. This rule never sees the radius.

WHAT IT COSTS, SAID OUT LOUD
----------------------------
Some legs are labelled for a road their baked route does not ride: the
curated I-65 leg from Huntsville to Nashville runs US-231 end to end
(``bake_divided`` independently measures the same leg as undivided). Under
this rule every curve on such a leg reads off-freeway, which is TRUE -- they
are not on I-65 -- but it silences a genuinely curvy drive rather than fixing
the label. ``--report`` prints those legs, ranked, from the per-leg freeway
coverage in the facts file, so they can be given routing pins later.

THE RESIDUAL, MEASURED
----------------------
Of the 15,752 interstate mainline rows that survive, 11,986 ride a way with
the leg's own shield, 3,640 a way carrying another route number, and 126 a
``motorway`` way with no ``ref`` at all -- which is where this rule cannot
tell "a freeway" from "the Interstate". They are urban freeway spaghetti
(the Whitehurst Freeway, Denver's West 6th Avenue Freeway, Tampa's Crosstown
Connector, the I-95 Express Toll Lanes), 37 of them ask a truck to slow, and
the 300 ft interstate screen takes most of those at load. Left alone: they
are real bends on real controlled-access road, and a second rule to chase
twenty records would be fitting to the residual.

CONNECTORS ARE ONLY EVER ADDED
------------------------------
A row the sweep already flagged stays flagged: the positional window catches
city geometry the class reading can miss, so this is a union, never a
replacement.

Nothing is deleted. Every row keeps its radius, deflection and advisory; only
``connector`` moves, and ``connector_source`` records which reading moved it,
so the rule can be re-judged from the shipped data without re-baking.

The facts file itself is NOT committed -- derived cache, regenerated in about
forty minutes by ``tools/curve_valhalla_facts.py``. The decision it feeds is
what ships, row by row, in ``connector_source``.

THE ORDER MATTERS, AND NOTHING ENFORCES IT
------------------------------------------
These four passes form a chain, each reading the output of the last. Run them
in this order after any change to the curve data::

    uv run python tools/curve_valhalla_facts.py --all      # what road is it on
    uv run python tools/bake_curve_connectors.py --write   # mainline or connector
    uv run python tools/clamp_curve_advisories.py --write  # cap the advisory
    uv run python tools/screen_curve_artifacts.py          # drop impossible geometry

Skipping the last has now stranded ``curve_artifacts.jsonl`` twice in a single
session. It names rows by ``(leg, seq)`` and only considers non-connector rows,
so the moment ``connector`` moves it can silently stop covering a row it used
to screen -- which is how a 44 ft radius turning 182 degrees survived as
mainline on US-30 out of Columbus. A stale screen does not announce itself.

Usage
-----
    uv run --group tooling python tools/curve_osm_facts.py --all   # slow, cached
    uv run python tools/bake_curve_connectors.py --report          # no write
    uv run python tools/bake_curve_connectors.py --write
    uv run python tools/bake_curve_connectors.py --check           # exit 1 if stale
