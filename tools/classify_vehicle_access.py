"""Classify every route stop by whether a rig can physically get into it.

Fills the ``vehicle_access`` field the game reads (see
``docs/truck-access-sweep-brief.md``). The map carries 1,082 generic
``fuel_station`` records, all tagged "limited truck parking" with no surveyed
capacity -- a uniform placeholder that hides real car-scale convenience stops
a 70-foot combination vehicle cannot enter. Announcing one is a promise the
player can take it, so each has to be judged against real evidence.

The evidence is OpenStreetMap, read through the self-hosted Overpass instance
at build time. Every stop already stores the lat/lon it was placed from, so
this looks up the actual tagged feature at that point and reads what the
mappers recorded: ``hgv``, ``access``, adjacent truck parking, whether the
site is a motorway service area or a tagged truck stop.

Rules, per the brief:

* NEVER filter by brand. Some Exxons and the Wawa Travel Center are genuinely
  truck-oriented. A chain name can VERIFY access (a Love's is a truck stop by
  nature) but never denies it -- an unrecognized brand just means "no evidence
  yet," which falls to the default.
* Default for a generic fuel station is ``bobtail_only``: on the map, reachable
  tractor-only, hidden from semi announcements and HOS planning.
* ``hgv=no`` or a closed ``access`` tag means no truck fits at all: ``none``.
* Facility types that are truck infrastructure by definition (truck stops,
  travel centers, service plazas, truck parking) stay ``tractor_trailer``
  unless OSM positively says otherwise.

Every decision writes a source note, and the Overpass answers are cached so
re-runs are deterministic and offline.
