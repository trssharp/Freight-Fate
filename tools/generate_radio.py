"""Generate in-cab radio music, host segments, and static via ElevenLabs.

Build-time only, like generate_sounds.py. Reads the ElevenLabs key from an
out-of-repo file (or ELEVENLABS_API_KEY / local ignored .env), composes
station music with the Eleven Music API, voices the Freight Fate Roadhouse
and Night Line hosts with the TTS API, and writes the project's Ogg Vorbis
convention with ffmpeg. The static burst is procedural (numpy) and costs no
credits. Never run at runtime; the key is never bundled.

Imaging (station-ID SFX beds) generates via the Sound Effects API, gated
behind --sfx since it spends credits; the post-production chain applied to
station-ID voice reads and ad reads (imaging_process / broadcast_compress /
mix_id_bed) is pure numpy and costs nothing -- see
tests/test_radio_imaging_chain.py for its numeric contract.

Usage:
    uv run python tools/generate_radio.py                # everything
    uv run python tools/generate_radio.py --hosts        # host lines only
    uv run python tools/generate_radio.py --music        # music only
    uv run python tools/generate_radio.py --static       # static burst only
    uv run python tools/generate_radio.py radio_country_backroads
    uv run python tools/generate_radio.py --voices --dry-run  # show what would be added
    uv run python tools/generate_radio.py --voices             # add missing cast voices
    uv run python tools/generate_radio.py --sfx                # imaging SFX beds (spends credits)

Plan-driven runners (tools/radio_generate_content.py, reading
tools/radio_content_plan.py -- STATIONS, AD_PLAN, SONG_PLAN):
    uv run python tools/generate_radio.py --plan-hosts            # every station's host lines
    uv run python tools/generate_radio.py --plan-hosts roadhouse  # one station's host lines
    uv run python tools/generate_radio.py --plan-ids               # spoken IDs + jingles, every station
    uv run python tools/generate_radio.py --plan-ids roadhouse    # one station's ID + jingles
    uv run python tools/generate_radio.py --plan-ads                # the shared ad rotation
    uv run python tools/generate_radio.py --plan-songs oldies       # one song pool
    uv run python tools/generate_radio.py --plan-songs oldies --limit 3  # cap fresh spend, resume later
    uv run python tools/generate_radio.py --plan-hosts --force      # regenerate even if the file exists
    uv run python tools/generate_radio.py --probe                   # measure real per-song credit cost
