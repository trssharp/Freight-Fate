"""Probe every real stream on the dial and report which ones still play.

The curated catalog and the imported directory tier both carry stream URLs
that were reachable when they were written down and may not be now: a
station folds, an account lapses, a host moves. A dead stream on the dial
costs a screen reader user a tune, a wait, and a fallback hand-off, so the
data should know which ones are gone.

This tool only *reports*. It writes a health file that
``tools/import_radio_catalog.py`` reads to drop dead imported rows at build
time, and prints the curated casualties for a human to mark
``"supported": false`` with a note. Nothing here edits a catalog.

Run from the repository root::

    uv run python tools/check_radio_streams.py
    uv run python tools/check_radio_streams.py --only curated --workers 8
    uv run python tools/check_radio_streams.py --recheck-dead

A probe asks for the first couple of kilobytes and hangs up. Verdicts:

``ok``        audio came back (or a Shoutcast v1 ``ICY 200 OK`` greeting).
``playlist``  a .pls/.m3u came back -- playable, but a redirect the game
              resolves at play time rather than a stream in its own right.
``dead``      the host said no: 4xx/5xx, refused, unknown name, or silence
              until the timeout. Retried once, and re-asked at the
              Shoutcast ``/;`` mount, before it counts.

Stations with no stream URL -- the built-in and playlist ones -- are never
probed and never appear in the report.

The report accumulates. A row dropped from the built catalog is no longer
there to probe, so a report written from scratch each time would forget it
and the next build would put it straight back on the dial; casualties are
carried forward until ``--recheck-dead`` sees one answer again.
