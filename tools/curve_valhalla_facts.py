"""What road does each baked curve sit on? Ask a map matcher.

This replaces the old ``curve_osm_facts.py`` (deleted), which answered the
same question by streaming 14 GB of Geofabrik extracts and taking the nearest
way segment to each curve's apex. Nearest-distance is the wrong tool: at an interchange the
ramp and the mainline it leaves are metres apart, and a point has no way to
know which one the truck is on.

Map matching does know, because it snaps the WHOLE polyline at once and the
answer has to be a connected path. Valhalla's ``trace_attributes`` returns,
per matched edge, the road class, whether the edge is a ramp or turn channel,
its names and refs, and its speed limit -- so the readings the connector bake
needs come from one call to a purpose-built matcher.

Two fields carry the verdict, and they are separate on purpose where OSM
conflates them into ``highway=*_link``:

  ``edge.use``         ``ramp`` or ``turn_channel`` -- interchange geometry,
                       whatever class of road it carries. A ramp off a trunk
                       is still a ramp.
  ``edge.road_class``  ``motorway``, ``trunk``, ``primary`` ... the through
                       road's own importance, which is what the connector
                       rule compares a bend against.

Coverage is all or nothing per leg: a leg whose polyline leaves the built
tileset comes back partly unmatched, and an unmatched apex is recorded as
having NO reading rather than guessed at. Build tiles covering the whole
network before trusting a run.

Running the matcher
-------------------
The tileset is built by the ``valhalla-scripted`` image. Three things bite on
Windows and are worth writing down:

  * ``tile_urls`` must be passed even when empty -- the entrypoint runs under
    ``set -u`` and dies on the unbound variable.
  * Git Bash mangles the volume path. Use ``MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1`` and a
    ``C:/...`` path, or the PBF is silently not mounted and the build reports
    "No local PBF files".
  * Do NOT disable ``build_admins``. The ``enhance`` stage uses the admin
    database and segfaults without it.

    MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker run -d --name valhalla -p 8002:8002 \\
      -v "C:/Users/joshu/.cache/valhalla/us:/custom_files" \\
      -e tile_urls= -e serve_tiles=True \\
      ghcr.io/valhalla/valhalla-scripted:latest

    The archive keeps a vertex wherever the road BENDS and drops them where it
    runs straight, which is exactly right for reading a curve and exactly
    wrong for reading what a leg is made of: the surviving vertices cluster on
    interchanges, ramps, city approaches and mountain bends, so a coverage
    sample taken only at vertices barely sees the long straight interstate
    running between them.

    Measured across the network, the bias is monotonic in how much the
    simplifier collapsed -- legs whose longest hop is under 5 percent of their
    length read a median 85 percent on their own shield, legs over 20 percent
    read 62 -- and it is worst on the freeway-heaviest legs, which are the
    ones with the longest tangents to collapse.

    Points go in at HALF the sample step. At exactly the step the sampler
    skips every other one -- it only takes a sample once the distance since
    the last one reaches the step, so a point landing a metre short is passed
    over and the next is a whole step late.

    Interpolating along the collapsed tangents costs nothing in fidelity: the
    chord IS the road there (a route point sits a median 0.009 miles off the
    archived line), which is why the simplifier was allowed to drop them.
