"""Generate sound-effect assets via the ElevenLabs Sound Effects API.

Build-time only. Reads the ElevenLabs key from an out-of-repo file (or the
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY env var or local ignored .env), requests each effect, and
converts the returned MP3 to the project's Ogg Vorbis convention with ffmpeg.
Never run at runtime and the key is never bundled.

Some cues are procedural instead: the weigh-station warning and the two
weigh-in-motion transponder verdicts are pure numpy arithmetic (same
deterministic-numpy tradition as generate_radio.py's
generate_static/generate_fringe), so they need no API key and spend no
credits. Both are generated as part of the default "everything" run, and can
also be built alone with --weigh-station-warning / --scale-verdict.

Usage:
    uv run python tools/generate_sounds.py            # generate the default set
    uv run python tools/generate_sounds.py events/police_siren
    uv run python tools/generate_sounds.py --weigh-station-warning  # procedural, no credits
    uv run python tools/generate_sounds.py --scale-verdict  # procedural, no credits

    the only event earcon carrying real low end: the enforcement marker
    (states/driving_siren.SIGNATURE_LOW_HZ, 660-1056 Hz) and ui/notify are
    both dry and high, so the weight alone keeps this unmistakable against
    either. Part two is a short bright two-note beep on its heel, like a
    scale readout locking a number in -- the half that actually reads as
    "the scale" rather than just "a warning". About 0.9 seconds end to end.

    Pure arithmetic, no random source: a rebuild always reproduces the same
    PCM audio (identical to sample precision, like every other numpy-synthed
    cue here). The committed .ogg itself can still change a few bytes run to
    run -- libvorbis stamps a fresh random stream serial into the Ogg
    container on every encode, the one part of this pipeline arithmetic does
    not control -- so the file that ships is whichever encode was committed,
    not something a rebuild should be expected to match byte for byte.
