"""The road a leg actually drives, read from the geometry archive.

Every corridor builder needs the same thing: a dense [(lat, lon, at_mi)]
polyline for one leg, on the leg's own mileage scale. Until now each of them
reached for it differently, and the two older routes both go wrong after a
reroute:

  * a cached OpenRouteService/OSRM response, keyed to the OLD route -- a
    cache miss on a rerouted leg, or worse, a hit describing the road the
    truck no longer drives;
  * straight segments between route_points, which sit 25 miles apart. A
    25-mile chord across a bend can run several miles off the pavement, and
    every builder that matches OSM features within a corridor tolerance
    quietly loses the ones the chord swung away from.

world_data/us/geometry/<state>.jsonl already holds the real polyline, at
full curve fidelity, checked in and offline. It is written by
bake_curve_geometry.py for a baked leg and by reroute_leg.py for a
rerouted one, so it is the one source that is right in both cases.

Read it first; fall back only when a leg has no archived record.
