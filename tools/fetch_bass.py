"""Fetch the BASS runtime the Rust audio backend loads.

BASS is un4seen's and proprietary. The game is free to ship it -- un4seen
charge nothing for non-commercial use -- but this repository is public
source, and hosting someone else's binaries there is a different thing from
bundling them in a release. So the libraries are fetched, not committed.

Where they land is what `crates/bass-sys` looks for:
`crates/bass-sys/vendor/<os>-<arch>/`, which its build script stages next to
the test and game binaries. `FREIGHT_FATE_BASS_PATH` overrides the lot if a
developer keeps BASS somewhere else.

Windows, macOS and Linux are all pinned. The macOS downloads are universal
binaries -- one file carrying the Intel and Apple silicon slices -- so the
same bytes are written into `macos-x86_64` and `macos-aarch64`, and a build
targeting either architecture finds its library. Linux takes the x86_64 or
the aarch64 slice of un4seen's `-linux` packages, whichever the machine is;
the aarch64 one is what the Blazie BT Speak and BT Braille (Raspberry Pi
Compute Module 4 and 5) run.

Every file is checked against a pinned sha256. A silent change upstream --
un4seen ship rolling updates behind stable URLs -- would otherwise walk into
a build with nothing said, and the audio backend is exactly where a quiet
substitution is hardest to notice.

    uv run python tools/fetch_bass.py            # fetch what is missing
    uv run python tools/fetch_bass.py --check    # verify, change nothing
    uv run python tools/fetch_bass.py --force    # re-fetch everything

# are NOT -- upstream has moved on -- and the AAC add-on is no longer at a
# guessable URL at all (every candidate 404s; it is behind the add-ons page).
# So those three come as plain files from sound_lib's own repository, at a
# pinned commit (an empty member means the URL is the file, not a zip).
# Re-pinning to current upstream builds is a deliberate job: fetch them,
# listen to the engine ring and a radio stream, then update these hashes.
