#!/bin/bash
# Boot the Linux release on a distribution other than the one that built it.
#
# Run inside a bare container of the distribution under test, with the
# repository (or just `dist/`) mounted at /work:
#
#     docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/work" fedora:latest bash /work/tools/linux_smoke.sh
#
# Both downloads are booted exactly as a player would: the tarball unpacked
# and its executable run, the AppImage run in place (extracted first,
# because a container has no FUSE). Each boots for five frames with SDL's
# dummy video and audio drivers, and the session log then has to say that
# BASS loaded from beside the executable. Speech is NOT disabled here:
# Prism is linked into the executable and opens the system's
# speech-dispatcher, which is where a distribution's loader would
# object if it were going to.
#
# Every log is also required to hold no error-level line at all: a boot
# that reaches the menu while something inside it failed is not a pass.
#
# On Fedora the tarball is booted a second time under Xvfb with SDL's real
# X11 driver, to prove the statically linked SDL2 finds the system's X
# libraries at run time, and Speech Dispatcher is installed and started
# first so the log has to show Prism choosing it on its own -- the same
# line a player's desktop produces. The other distributions run the dummy
# driver with no speech daemon; that is the loader and glibc check, which
# is what differs between them.
#
# What each container is given is what every desktop install already has:
# libdbus-1 (the executable links it for the Secret Service keyring),
# libstdc++, and speech-dispatcher's client library (Prism links it; a
# desktop with Orca already has it). Nothing else is installed -- a distribution that needs
# more is a finding, not something to paper over here.
#
# The container's own architecture decides which pair of downloads is
# booted: the x64 tarball and x86_64 AppImage on a PC runner, the arm64
# tarball and aarch64 AppImage on an ARM64 one (the Blazie BT Speak and BT
# Braille are Debian on a Raspberry Pi Compute Module, so the debian
# containers on the ARM runner are the closest stand-in the nightly has).
