"""Declarative content plan for every fictional Freight Fate station.

Pure data, no I/O: casting, host scripts, station IDs, jingle prompts, the
shared ad pool, the song batches, and the imaging SFX prompts. Consumed by
tools/generate_radio.py at build time and by the copy tests; nothing here
runs in the shipped game.

Conventions (the asset contract):
- ``STATIONS`` is keyed by content key -- the value the catalog's ``host``
  field will carry. Host clips become ``host_<key>_NN.ogg``, produced
  jingles ``id_<key>_01/02/04``, the spoken legal ID ``id_<key>_03``, and
  the spoken liners after it ``id_<key>_05/06`` (second wave, merged in
  from radio_content_liners.py).
- Voice names are cast against the owner's REAL ElevenLabs roster (33
  on-account voices plus five proven library adds: Thomas, Patrick,
  Rachel, Michael, Amelia) -- never invent a name outside that set.
  Casting is one to one: no two stations share a primary voice and no
  fallback is a primary or ad voice. The roster is finite, so fallback
  names may back more than one station, capped at three (19 primaries +
  6 ad voices leave 13 names for 38 fallback slots; a cap of two tops
  out at 26 slots, so three is the tightest cap that fits). Ad voices
  are disjoint from ALL station casting (primary and fallback): a
  station host never reads a commercial on the dial.
- Ad keys are ``ad_<slug>``; ``formats`` lists the STATION_PLAYLISTS pools
  the spot may air on (never "route": the Roadhouse draws no ads).
- Song keys follow the shipped catalog: ``radio_<pool>_<slug>``, with the
  historical stems ``radio_rock_`` for classic_rock and ``radio_night_``
  for the Night Line vocal pool.

Everything in ``host_lines``, ``id_lines``, and ad ``script`` fields is
player-facing spoken text for blind players: plain road language, no key
or menu names, no dates, no weather promises, no real brands.
