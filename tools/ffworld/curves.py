"""Baked curve geometry for the pacenote layer.

Reads ``world_data/us/gameplay/curves.jsonl`` -- the per-curve steering
rows from the dense geometry sweep (one bake direction per leg; the
runtime mirrors records when a route traverses a leg b-to-a). Connector
rows (interchange and ramp arcs) are excluded here: ramps carry their own
speech and the future curve-nav layer owns them.

Which rows those are is READ from OSM at bake time, not guessed at here:
``tools/bake_curve_connectors.py`` sets ``connector`` from the road class
under each curve's apex -- a ``highway=*_link`` way is a ramp, and an
Interstate leg's curve that is not on ``highway=motorway`` is not on the
Interstate. Each flagged row records which reading flagged it in
``connector_source``.

Severity bands come from the advisory speed the bake computed at 0.3 g
lateral -- the same number a posted yellow diamond would show -- EXCEPT the
hairpin, which is a shape rather than a speed and is decided by deflection
alone (see ``HAIRPIN_DEFLECTION_DEG``).

Interstate mainline records are screened for sweep artifacts on the way in
(see ``INTERSTATE_MIN_RADIUS_FT``); the raw bake keeps every row.

US and state routes get a second, narrower screen: sweep artifacts also
land on non-interstate mainline (the same city-departure kink that hits an
interstate can ride the US-route out of the same city), but road class
alone cannot tell those apart from a real switchback -- US-550 and the Salt
River Canyon really are that sharp. ``curve_artifacts.jsonl``
(``tools/screen_curve_artifacts.py``) names the specific ``(leg, seq)``
records an offline check flagged: flat local ground where no real hairpin
can exist, city-departure geometry at a leg's ends off the mountains, and a
radius no through highway of any class can bend to. Everything else, sharp
or not, is left alone -- nothing in mountain terrain is ever flagged.

A third screen applies to mainline of every class and asks only whether a
record agrees with itself: a bend's recorded span has to be able to hold the
arc its own radius and deflection describe, and opposite-direction curves
cannot meet with no straight between them. Terrain cannot excuse either, so
unlike the two above, this one does look at mountain roads -- which is where
it was found (``ARC_CONSISTENCY_MIN``).

# separately and much lower down, using the Turn sign (W1-1) instead of the
# Curve sign at 30 mph or less.
#
# This used to read "advisory <= 25 OR deflection >= 150", and the advisory
# half was doing real damage. Across 33,930 baked curves it labelled 159
# hairpins where only 99 turn 135 degrees or more; the other 60 were tight
# little bends taken slowly, and the worst of them deflect TEN degrees. A
# driver was being told "hairpin left" for a road that barely bends, which
# spends the word on nothing and leaves it meaning less when a real
# switchback arrives. Darren asked whether a 94-degree corner through
# Norwich on NY-12 was "supposed to be there" (2026-08-23); the corner was,
# the word was not.
#
# The angle is necessary and NOT sufficient, which the data made plain. MUTCD
# says the hairpin sign goes up INSTEAD OF A TURN OR CURVE SIGN, and it is
# the Turn sign (advisory 30 or less) that a switchback would otherwise
# carry. Taking the angle alone put 7 hairpins on interstate mainline --
# among them a 143-degree bend on I-49 north of Fayetteville with an 811 ft
# radius and a 60 mph advisory. That is a real half-circle of road and a
# sweeping one; no driver calls it a hairpin, because you do not slow for it.
#
# Both together give 46 hairpins in 33,930 curves and NONE on an interstate,

# a digitizing artifact.
#
# That misclassification is now fixed where it happened -- the bake reads the
# road class under each apex (see the module docstring) -- so this screen has
# far less to catch than it did. It stays as the backstop for rows no extract
# could speak to, and because a genuine digitizing kink on real interstate
# pavement is still possible.
#
# 300 is deliberately far below the DESIGN floor, and the difference is not
# slack -- it is Glenwood Canyon. TxDOT Roadway Design Manual Table 4-7 puts

# lowest the Interstate system designs to; raising this constant to 758

# (tried and reverted, 2026-08-23 -- test_glenwood_canyon_interstate_curves
# _survive is what caught it). A screen sized to the design floor cannot
# tell a design exception from an artifact.
#
# The design floor IS applied, by the fourth screen below, and only where the
