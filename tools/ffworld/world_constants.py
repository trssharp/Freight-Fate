# Geography gates for template facilities. Market tags apply per region or
# state, which over-stamps water- and rail-dependent facility types onto
# cities that plainly lack them (a port terminal in landlocked Lampasas).
# The tags themselves stay untouched -- they also drive cargo-weight
# bonuses -- only the stamped facility is gated here.
#
# Cities that plausibly host a working port terminal: deep-water coastal,
# Great Lakes, or navigable-river barge ports per MARAD/USACE port and
# waterway profiles. A template port_terminal is only stamped in these.
