"""Canonical region taxonomy and coordinate-based classification.

A city's ``region`` is *derived* from its state and coordinates at build time
and baked into ``world.json``. ``classify_region`` is the single source of
truth: the stored-equals-derived test asserts every city's stored region equals
``classify_region(state, lat, lon)``, so a misclassification (such as Reno being
tagged the Rockies) cannot recur as the map grows.

The taxonomy blends NOAA climate regions (which drive weather flavor) with USGS
physiographic provinces (which drive grades and hazards), refined for freight
character. See ``docs/osm-routing-plan.md`` for the full design and the rationale
behind each region.

The classifier is deliberately a state map plus a few coordinate split rules for
states that span more than one region, rather than a heavyweight GIS polygon
set: it is deterministic, dependency-free, has no runtime cost, and is exactly
testable against the known cities. Single-region assignments for large states
and the split thresholds are approximations refined as the map grows; the
per-city test is the guardrail.
