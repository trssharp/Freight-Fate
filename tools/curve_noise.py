"""How often does the road ask a loaded truck to slow down?

Counts curves through the GAME's loader, so every screen and the flagged
artifact list are applied. A raw count out of the bake answers a different
question and has been mistaken for this one.

Two numbers per leg, because they move independently:

* **mainline curves** -- every bend the bake kept on the through road.
  Connector arcs are excluded: interchange ramps really are that sharp and
  carry their own speech, so counting them buries the signal. Counting them
  turned 199 into 18,187 the first time this was written.
* **calls at 65 or less** -- bends a truck holding an interstate limit has
  to come off the throttle for. That is the count a player HEARS.

The four controls are roads whose bends are known and real -- they are the
reason the feature exists. A change that quiets the network is only good if
these hold. Twice a screen that looked like a clean win on the totals had
taken Glenwood Canyon apart: the canyon follows the river at mild grade, so
its ground reads flat while the walls force the bends, and any rule keyed on
terrain relief deletes it.
