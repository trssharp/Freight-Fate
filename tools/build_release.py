"""Build a standalone Freight Fate distribution.

Packages the Rust game and archives it for release:

* Windows: ``dist/FreightFate-<label>-windows-portable.zip``
* Linux:   ``dist/FreightFate-<label>-linux-x64.tar.gz`` on x86_64, and
  ``dist/FreightFate-<label>-linux-arm64.tar.gz`` on aarch64 (the Blazie
  BT Speak and BT Braille, Raspberry Pi and other ARM64 Linux machines)
* macOS Apple Silicon: ``dist/FreightFate-<label>-macos-arm64.zip``
* macOS Intel: ``dist/FreightFate-<label>-macos.zip``

``<label>`` is the project version from pyproject.toml, or the value of
``--tag`` (used for nightly developer snapshots).

Run from the repository root: ``uv run python tools/build_release.py``

The pipeline is ``cargo build --release -p freight-fate``
(``--cargo-target-dir`` picks the Cargo target directory), then ``ff-bake``
to turn the JSON data tree into ``world.ffdata``, then a ``FreightFate/``
folder with the executable renamed to ``FreightFate``. On macOS it creates
``FreightFate.app`` with the executable under ``Contents/MacOS``, native
libraries under ``Contents/Frameworks``, and data, packs, build metadata, and
documents under ``Contents/Resources``; macOS builds are ad-hoc signed, with no
Apple Developer ID or notarization, so a downloaded app can need the
documented first-launch Open Anyway step. ``--rust`` is accepted for the
callers that still pass it; it is the only mode.
