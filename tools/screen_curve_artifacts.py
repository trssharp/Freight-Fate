"""Screen US/state-route curve artifacts the interstate screen can't reach.

Background
----------
``data/curves.py`` already drops interstate-mainline curve records that are
too sharp for an interstate to physically hold (radius < 300 ft or
deflection >= 150 deg) -- sweep artifacts from city-departure geometry and
interchange vertices baked as if they were mainline (ROADMAP, "Screen
artifact curves out of the highway bake", shipped 2026-08-09). That screen is
gated on highway class alone, because on an interstate NOTHING that sharp is
real. US and state routes are different: US-550 over Red Mountain Pass and
the Salt River Canyon on US-60 have hundreds of genuine sub-300-ft hairpins,
so gating on class would delete real switchbacks. The shipped screen's own
notes flagged the gap: "the same Denver departure artifact rides the US-40
leg, and no measured signal separates artifact from real switchback on that
class -- a future US/state pass needs a different discriminator."

The discriminators
------------------
All three ask the same question -- could a road of this class physically hold
this bend here? -- of a hairpin-severity curve (the same test
``RouteCurve.severity`` uses: advisory <= 25 mph or deflection >= 150 deg).
None of them looks at road class, because US and state routes really do
switch back.

``flat`` -- the curve sits on demonstrably FLAT local ground. No real hairpin
exists without a hill to switch back on. This reuses the exact terrain verdict
``reclassify_terrain.py`` computes from the dense archived elevation profile
(``world_data/us/geometry/``) and the shared ``terrain_rules`` thresholds, so
"flat" here means what it means everywhere else in the data.

``leg_end`` -- the curve sits within ``LEG_END_MI`` of either end of the leg,
on ground that is not "mountain". A leg ends at a city node, and the bake
stitches city-departure street geometry onto the mainline there; that is the
same artifact ``flat`` was built for, and terrain alone cannot see it once the
city sits on rolling ground. Mountain terrain is spared because a town in the
mountains really can have a switchback on its doorstep (US-119 out of
Charleston, KY-80 out of Hazard, US-95 out of Lewiston -- all preserved).

``radius`` -- the curve is tighter than ``MIN_ROAD_RADIUS_FT``, anywhere on
any leg. This is the sibling of the interstate screen's 300 ft floor, set
instead at the point no through highway of any class can bend: 50 ft is
tighter than a loaded tractor-trailer's own turning circle. The floor is
grounded in the data rather than assumed -- the tightest genuine switchback
the world carries is 54 ft (US-550 over Red Mountain Pass, mile 60.5), and
nothing in mountain terrain falls below the floor at all.

Verified against known cases before fanning out (see the tool's own
``--report``): the Denver-departure kink on US-40 (mile 1.7, flat) is
flagged; the mid-canyon US-40 hairpin over the Rockies foothills (mile
104, hills) is not; every US-550 Million Dollar Highway switchback and
every Salt River Canyon (Globe->Show Low, US-60) switchback reads
"mountain" and survives untouched. Across the whole world the three screens
together flag nothing in mountain terrain, which is the property to check
first if these thresholds are ever moved.

Output
------
Like ``ramps.jsonl`` and ``speed_limits.jsonl``, this is a small sibling
gameplay table under ``world_data/us/gameplay/`` -- NOT an edit to
``curves.jsonl``. The raw bake keeps every row (existing invariant); flagged
records are named in ``curve_artifacts.jsonl`` by ``(leg, seq)`` and
``data/curves.py`` skips them on load, exactly like the interstate screen
skips its records in memory rather than rewriting the archive.

THE ORDER MATTERS, AND NOTHING ENFORCES IT
------------------------------------------
These four passes form a chain, each reading the output of the last. Run them
in this order after any change to the curve data::

    uv run python tools/curve_valhalla_facts.py --all      # what road is it on
    uv run python tools/bake_curve_connectors.py --write   # mainline or connector
    uv run python tools/clamp_curve_advisories.py --write  # cap the advisory
    uv run python tools/screen_curve_artifacts.py          # drop impossible geometry

Skipping the last one has now stranded ``curve_artifacts.jsonl`` twice in a
single session. It names rows by ``(leg, seq)`` and only considers non-connector
rows, so the moment ``connector`` moves it can silently stop covering a row it
used to screen -- which is how a 44 ft radius turning 182 degrees survived as
mainline on US-30 out of Columbus. A stale screen does not announce itself; it
just quietly stops catching things.

Usage
-----
    uv run python tools/screen_curve_artifacts.py             # write + report
    uv run python tools/screen_curve_artifacts.py --check      # report only, exit 1 if stale
    uv run python tools/screen_curve_artifacts.py --report     # human-readable breakdown, no write
