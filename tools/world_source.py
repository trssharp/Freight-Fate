"""Load and save the editable world source, sharded per state.

The build tools used to read and write a single 60 MB
``data/world.json``. That file (and the runtime
``world_data/us/legs.json`` it generates) had grown past GitHub's 50 MB
warning line and was heading for the 100 MB hard limit, and every data
sweep committed a 60 MB blob no reviewer could read. The source is now a
tree of per-state shards:

.. code-block:: text

    data/world_source/
      meta.json         # every top-level key that is not cities or legs
      cities.json       # {"cities": {...}} -- small enough to stay whole
      legs/TX.json      # {"legs": [...]} for legs starting in Texas
      legs/CA.json
      ...

``load_world()`` returns the same merged dict the tools have always seen,
so a tool migrates by swapping its ``json.loads(WORLD_PATH.read_text())``
for ``load_world()`` and its ``WORLD_PATH.write_text(json.dumps(...))``
for ``save_world(data)``. Nothing else about a tool changes.

A leg is filed under the state of its ``from`` city, so editing one leg
rewrites one small file instead of the monolith. Both shard files and the
leg order inside them are sorted, so the same data always produces the
same bytes -- the deterministic-and-offline rule the map data lives by.
