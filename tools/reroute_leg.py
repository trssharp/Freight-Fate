"""Put a leg back on the road it is named for.

Thirty legs are labelled for an interstate their baked route never joins. A
truck router settles which fault it is (see ``tools/repair_leg_labels.py``):
where the interstate genuinely serves the pair, the LABEL is right and the
baked ROUTE is wrong. Corpus Christi to San Antonio is 98 percent I-37 by any
sane routing, and the archived polyline runs US-181 instead.

This replaces such a leg's route with the one a truck would actually take,
and re-derives the layers that ride on it.

WHY IT IS SAFE TO DO NOW, HAVING SAID IT WAS NOT
------------------------------------------------
The earlier reading of this was that rerouting would strip a leg of its 807
landmarks, 532 interchanges and 81 stops because those came from Overpass,
which is not running. That was wrong, and worth correcting rather than
quietly working around: the enrichment was never gone, it had simply never
been pointed at a new route. Every corridor builder now reads the leg's
polyline from the geometry archive (``tools/leg_geometry.py``) instead of
re-routing it, and the archive is what this tool writes.

THIS IS THE FIRST HALF
----------------------
It settles the route and writes it. It does NOT re-derive the layers that
ride on it, and a leg is not shippable until they are back -- a leg without
``grade_segments`` has no grade simulation at all, which is why the first
trial of this was reverted rather than committed::

    reroute_leg.py    --leg a:b --write                    # the road
    reroute_enrich.py --leg a:b --pbf us.osm.pbf --write   # everything on it

``--check`` on either tool lists any leg left between the two.

TRAPS ALREADY PAID FOR
----------------------
Dropping route_points as "stale" and stopping there leaves the enrichment
builders with no bounds to prefilter a local OSM extract by, and
``build_interchanges`` then retained 0 of 59,924 ramp nodes and exited 0 -- a
tool that finds nothing and reports success. That is why this writes new
route_points and elevation_samples rather than only clearing the old.

``--only`` on every builder in the chain takes SLUGS, never spoken city
names, and the interchange sub-mode flags do not compose: passing
``--maxspeed --restrictions --ramp-controls`` together dispatches to one and
silently skips the rest. ``reroute_enrich.py`` runs them in sequence.

WHAT THIS TOOL DOES AND DOES NOT DO
-----------------------------------
It writes the new polyline into the geometry archive, sets ``leg.miles`` from
the router's own distance, and drops every corridor layer keyed to the OLD
polyline, because those are now wrong rather than merely stale -- a landmark
at mile 40 of a route that no longer passes it is worse than no landmark.
Rebuilding them is ``reroute_enrich.py``, and the leg is INCOMPLETE until
that has run. ``--check`` reports any leg left in that state.

Curated CHECKPOINTS are the exception and are re-positioned rather than
dropped: see ``CHECKPOINT_MAX_OFF_MI`` below.

Elevation is refetched from Valhalla ``/height`` along the new shape, because
grades are the one layer a driver feels immediately and a stale grade is a
lie the truck tells with its engine.

# Neither are STOPS, and for a different reason. A stop is a real named

# nothing to re-position it against, and the two honest options are to drop
# the curation or to carry it across proportionally. It is carried: dropping
# seven truck stops off a leg takes its fuel, its parking and its food with
# them, which is a worse leg than one whose stop sits a mile out. The same
# proportional rule ``repair_leg_mileage.py`` uses for every other along-route
# position, and it is recorded in the stop's own source line so nobody later
