"""Correct leg mileages that fall short of the road the leg was baked from.

WHAT IS WRONG
-------------
``leg.miles`` is a curated number, and on some legs it is simply too small.
Poplar Bluff to Jonesboro is stored as 55 miles; the route baked for it is
95. Altus to Wichita Falls says 50 and is 85. Greenville to New Bern says 35
and is 58.

36 of them are impossible on their own terms: the stored mileage is less
than the STRAIGHT-LINE distance between the two city nodes, and no road is
shorter than the straight line between its endpoints. That test needs no
other data and no judgement.

Nothing has caught this because everything agrees with it. The corridor bake
rescales every layer onto ``leg.miles`` (``mile_scale`` in
``bake_curve_geometry``), so the grades end exactly at the stored figure, the
landmarks stop there, and ``state_miles`` sums to it precisely. They are not
independent witnesses; they are the same number wearing different hats.

It matters because leg miles drive pay, deadlines, fuel and the odometer. A
leg that pays for 55 miles while the truck drives 95 is a bad deal the player
cannot see. And the same rescaling squeezes that leg's curve, grade and
speed-limit positions into 58 percent of the road they belong on.

THE CORRECT VALUE, AND WHY IT IS A LOWER BOUND
----------------------------------------------
``world_data/us/geometry/<state>.jsonl`` holds the polyline every corridor
layer was baked from. Its length is a LOWER BOUND on the real road, and
provably so: the archive is a Douglas-Peucker subset of the route's vertices,
and dropping a vertex replaces a two-segment path with its chord, which is
never longer. So archived <= what ORS returned <= the real road.

That is what makes the correction safe in one direction. A leg whose curated
mileage sits BELOW the archive is short of a proven floor, so raising it to
the floor can only move it toward the truth. Legs already above the archive
are left alone -- the archive understates, so being above it proves nothing.

Measured, the simplification costs about 0.1 percent: across the 852 legs
whose curated figure agrees with the archive to within rounding, the median
gap is a tenth of a mile in a hundred. So a corrected leg still reads a
touch short, and knowingly so.

THE LINE IS ROUNDING, NOT A THRESHOLD
-------------------------------------
Curated mileages are whole miles, so a leg whose true length is 55.4 stored
as 55 reads 0.4 short of the archive through rounding alone. ``ROUNDING_MI``
is that half-mile and nothing more; there is no tuned parameter here. The
shortfall distribution has no gap to cut at anyway -- it decays smoothly from
51 miles down to nothing -- which is exactly why the line has to come from
the arithmetic rather than from the shape.

RESCALING, AND THE ONE FIELD THAT MUST NOT MOVE
-----------------------------------------------
Every layer is keyed to leg-miles, so correcting the length without moving
them would misplace all of it. Each along-route position scales by
``new/old``. The fields are named explicitly in ``ALONG_ROUTE`` rather than
matched by pattern, and the run FAILS if it meets a mileage-looking field the
list does not know -- a schema addition must not be silently left behind.

``landmarks[].off_mi`` is deliberately absent from that list: it is how far a
village sits OFF the road, not where along it, and scaling it would push
every town further into the fields.
