"""Put a leg's archived line back on the road, without re-routing it.

bake_curve_geometry does this as part of a full re-bake, but that needs
Overpass for shields, postings and ramps, and Overpass refuses long-corridor
queries often enough that a 24-leg run died on leg five. The geometry itself
needs nothing but the router and an elevation service, both of which answer
every time, so this does that half alone.

What it will NOT do is move a leg to a different road. The leg's mileage is
curated -- pay, deadlines and every mile-keyed layer hang off it -- so a new
shape is only adopted when it agrees with that mileage. If the router has
picked a different road the length will disagree, and the leg is refused and
reported rather than quietly re-routed.

Two screens, both derived from the leg's own record rather than from a
threshold picked to look right:

  * length agreement -- the new shape's own length against the miles the leg
    is paid on. Beyond MAX_LENGTH_DRIFT the router chose a different road,
    whatever else is true.
  * it must actually help -- the new line's worst distance from any road has
    to beat the old one's. A repair that does not improve the thing it was
    called for is not adopted.
