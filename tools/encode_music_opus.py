"""Re-encode the music library to Ogg Opus, from WAV masters where we have them.

The music is 236 MB of the 282 MB download -- 84% of what a player pulls, and
the only part still growing as tracks are added. Opus at 80 kbps stereo roughly
halves it with no perceptible loss on background beds sitting under speech, and
both audio backends already decode it (core BASS opens .opus with no plugin;
the SDL_mixer fallback does too), so this is a data swap, not an engine change.

Two sources, by necessity:

* WAV masters (Josh's Suno/ElevenLabs renders, 48 kHz/16-bit): a clean
  single-generation encode. Matched to a shipped track by DURATION, never by
  filename -- the masters arrived with inconsistent names ("Urban Roll.wav" is
  ``menu_urban_roll``, "Greywater Quay.wav" is ``radio_rock_greywater_quay``)
  and a couple of 8-minute files that match no shipped edit at all. Duration is
  the fingerprint that cannot lie about which track this is.
* The shipped Ogg Vorbis, for every track with no WAV master. Vorbis->Opus is
  lossy-to-lossy and degrades slightly, but the owner A/B'd it and could not
  distinguish 64k Opus from the 160k Vorbis on monitors.

A WAV is only accepted for a stem when its duration matches within
``DURATION_TOLERANCE_S``; anything else is reported and left to the Ogg path,
so a mislabelled master can never ship under the wrong track name.

The WAV masters zip defaults to the owner's machine and most contributors
won't have it -- that's fine, the tool falls back to encoding every track
from the shipped Ogg. Point ``FREIGHT_FATE_WAV_MASTERS`` at your own copy of
the zip to get the WAV path instead.

Usage: ``uv run --with av python tools/encode_music_opus.py`` (``av`` is not
a project dependency, so it's supplied per-invocation rather than pinned in
pyproject). Add ``--write`` to actually encode; without it this only prints
the plan.
