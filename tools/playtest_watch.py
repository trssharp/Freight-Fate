"""Watch a live manual playtest and report what is worth interrupting for.

A playtest is somebody driving a truck by ear for half an hour. Whoever is
running the session cannot read a log at the same time, and the interesting
lines -- a traceback, a cloud request from a session that was supposed to be
sandboxed, a warning nobody heard over the engine -- are a few among tens of
thousands. This reads the session log as it is written and prints one line per
thing worth knowing, so a shell watching this script's stdout gets a
notification instead of a wall of text.

Three duties, deliberately different in cadence:

* **Now.** Errors, tracebacks, and any request that reached the site are
  printed the moment they land. These are the reason the watcher exists.
* **Occasionally.** Every few minutes, one check-in line: where the drive has
  got to and what was last spoken. It goes quiet on its own when nothing is
  happening -- a truck parked in a menu should not generate news -- and speaks
  up again when the road starts talking.
* **After.** When the game exits, one closing summary: how long, how much was
  spoken, what went wrong, and whether the sandbox really did stay off the
  network.

Run it against a session started by the game's sandbox launcher
(``freightfate --playtest-sandbox --launch``, or ``--playtest-road``)::

    uv run python tools/playtest_watch.py

Or point it at any session log, with a faster check-in for a short drive::

    uv run python tools/playtest_watch.py --log logs/playtest.log --every 60

It exits when the session does, so a shell can wait on it.
