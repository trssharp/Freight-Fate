# The release-note gate resolves its base by measuring the branch point
# against origin/dev and origin/main, and a cloud container clones a single
# branch -- so on a session started from any other branch the gate cannot
# see one or both release lines, and silently scores the current branch
# against whichever it does have.
#
# The refspecs are spelled out because a --single-branch clone configures
# remote.origin.fetch for that branch alone: `git fetch origin main` there
# lands in FETCH_HEAD and never creates refs/remotes/origin/main. Fetched
# one at a time so a release line that does not exist yet costs only its
# own warning, and non-fatal so a container without network still gets a
# usable checkout.
