# Freight Fate ontology

What kinds of things exist in Freight Fate, what the code calls them, and --
the part that reaches players -- what the game *says* out loud for each one.

Two audiences. A contributor adding a feature should be able to find out
whether the concept already exists under another name. A contributor writing
spoken text should be able to find out which word the game already uses, so a
screen reader user does not hear three nouns for one thing.

This is a contributor document. Nothing here is player-facing, so changes to it
alone take `[skip changelog]`.

## Two tiers

Freight Fate's entities divide into a portable model layer and a game layer.

**The portable layer** -- `models/` and most of `sim/` -- describes the world,
the freight, the driver and the equipment. None of it should know that
Freight Fate is a Pygame program: no pygame import, no audio backend, no
speech. That rule is not stylistic. It is what keeps the model layer testable
headless and reusable, and it is enforced by convention today, so watch for it
in review.

**The game layer** -- `states/`, the audio and speech stack, saves, online
services -- is Freight Fate specific and always will be.

The portable layer's vocabulary is documented alongside the code that owns it.
This file catalogues the game layer, and then the spoken vocabulary for both.

## Game-layer entities

### The save

| Concept | Class | Module |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Profile | `Profile` | `models/profile.py` |
| Truck condition | `TruckCondition` | `models/trucks.py` |
| Duty log | `DutyLog` | `sim/hos.py` |
| Loyalty account | `LoyaltyAccount` | `models/loyalty.py` |
| Radio favorite (spoken "favorites", a saved station) | `RadioState.favorite_ids` | `radio.py` |
| Radio app (the Driver apps tablet app that searches the dial, tunes by name, and keeps favorites; "Search stations", "Stations in range", "Favorites") | `RadioAppState`, `RadioState.search`, `RadioState.favorites` | `states/driving_radio_app.py`, `radio.py` |
| Now playing (spoken "Now playing on <station>: <song>"; what a stream says it is playing -- "song information" when there is none) | `_radio_now_playing_text`, `AudioEngine.radio_now_playing`, `parse_icy_stream_title` | `states/driving_updates.py`, `audio.py` |
| Personal playlist station (one of the player's own playlist files on the dial) | `PERSONAL_PLAYLIST_SOURCE_TYPE`, `load_personal_playlists` | `radio.py` |
| Save migration | `migrate_save_data`, `SAVE_VERSION` | `models/save_migration.py` |
| Career from an earlier version (the 1.9 cutover gate; never "legacy" in spoken text) | `created_line`, `LegacyCareerError` | `models/profile.py` |
| Integrity signature | `SIGNATURE_FIELD`, `ProfileIntegrityError` | `models/profile.py` |
| Profile invariants | -- | `profile_invariants.py`, `profile_integrity_invariants.py` |

`Profile` is the root of everything persisted. It *holds* a `Career`, a
`Market`, an `HosClock`, a `DutyLog`, a `LoyaltyAccount`, per-truck
`TruckCondition` records, the business standing (status, carrier, start mode,
authority readiness), owned and programme trailers, active buffs, the money,
the in-game clock, the achievement list, and an `active_trip` snapshot. It is
the one object whose shape is a compatibility contract in three directions at
once: older saves, the cloud validator, and the integrity signature. Add fields
with defaults; never reorder or repurpose.

The business fields are the ones to be most careful with, because they are read
by the cloud validator as well as by the game. The allow-list there is a
superset and the required set is only what the checks actually read -- exact
field matching rejects both older and newer builds.

### Carrier and equipment

| Concept | Class | Module |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fleet tier | `FleetTier` | `models/carrier_fleet.py` |
| Trailer unit | `TrailerUnit` | `models/trailer_yard.py` |
| Pickup plan | `PickupPlan` | `models/trailer_yard.py` |
| Delivery plan | `DeliveryPlan` | `models/trailer_yard.py` |
| Truck dealer (spoken "truck dealer", or the source-backed local dealer name when one exists) | `TruckShopState` | `states/city_business.py` |

A `FleetTier` is what a carrier *assigns* at a level band: a company driver
does not choose a tractor, they are given one. An owner-operator owns theirs.
The same `truck` field on the profile means "assigned tractor" or "active owned
tractor" depending on business status, which is worth remembering before
writing any sentence about "your truck".

`TruckCondition` is per-truck persistent state -- fuel, damage, tire wear,
grime -- keyed by catalog key. It is deliberately *not* portable: condition
belongs to the truck you own in this game, not to the driver.

### The live drive

| Concept | Class | Module |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trip | `Trip` | `sim/trip.py` |
| Route helpers | -- | `sim/trip_route_helpers.py` |
| Road events | `TripRoadEventMixin` | `sim/trip_road_events.py` |
| Traffic on the trip | `TripTrafficMixin` | `sim/trip_traffic.py` |
| Lane keeping | `LaneKeeping` | `sim/lane.py` |
| Lane keeping (the setting) | `lane_keeping` | `settings.py`, `states/main_menu.py` |
| The lane you came out of being open again | `LaneGapMixin` | `states/driving_lane_gap.py` |
| Driving mode tuning | `DrivingModeTuning` | `sim/driving_modes.py` |
| Driving mode (the setting): relaxed, standard, real time | `time_scale`, `TIME_SCALES` | `settings.py`, `states/main_menu.py` |
| Pedal latch | `PedalLatch` | `sim/pedal_latch.py` |
| A tank load and its sloshing wave | `LiquidLoad`, `SloshAxis` | `sim/surge.py` |
| Stop-cue geometry from stopping distance | -- | `states/driving_stops.py` |
| Planned rest-stop stopping assistance | `selected_stop_assist` | `settings.py`, `states/driving_events.py` |
| Destination approach assistance | `destination_approach_assist` | `settings.py`, `states/driving_updates.py` |
| Traffic vehicle | `TrafficVehicle`, `TrafficSituation`, `TrafficManager` | `sim/traffic_manager.py` |
| Live traffic | `TrafficEvent`, `TrafficData`, `RealTrafficProvider` | `sim/real_traffic.py` |
| Truck parking | `TruckParkingLocation`, `ParkingData`, `TruckParkingProvider` | `sim/truck_parking.py` |
| Enforcement post | `EnforcementPost` | `sim/enforcement_posts.py` |
| What a post noticed | `Observation`, `RoadSample` | `sim/enforcement_observe.py` |
| The enforcement watch on the drive | `EnforcementWatchMixin` | `states/driving_enforcement.py` |
| The held siren and its signature | `SirenLoop` | `states/driving_siren.py` |
| The safety record | -- | `models/safety_record.py` |
| Time zone | `TimeZone` | `sim/timezones.py` |
| Live weather | `RealWeatherProvider` | `sim/real_weather.py` |

Two kinds of traffic exist and they are not the same concept. `TrafficManager`
simulates the vehicles around the truck right now -- the ones a player hears
and reacts to. `RealTrafficProvider` fetches real-world incident data for the
route ahead. A sentence about "traffic" should make clear which one it means.

Spoken, the second one is a **live road report** -- never an "alert", and
never phrased as the state of the road ahead. It is a state DOT feed
describing the real road today, and the simulation does not act on it: a
reported closure does not close anything. Calling it an alert made a driver
believe the road in front of him was shut, and it was not (Brandon,
2026-08-21). The spoken frame carries the provenance the same way a data
`source` field does -- this came from outside, and the road under the wheels
is the game's own.

Three providers -- weather, traffic and parking -- reach the network. All of
them must degrade to the baked data silently; nothing in the drive may block on
one.

An enforcement post is a PLACE (a milepost with a body in it, or not) and an
observation is an EVENT (that body noticing one thing about your truck, with a
confidence). Keeping them apart is what lets presence be constant while
consequence stays rare: a run is full of posts and almost never produces an
observation. "Observed" is an internal word and is never spoken.

`Trip` is the binding entity: it joins a driver, a truck, a job and a route
into one moving thing, and it owns the clock. Everything the player hears while
driving is a projection of a `Trip`. Game hours are absolute Eastern; local
time is a view, via `Trip.local_hour`.

### Player-facing systems

| Concept | Class | Module |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Achievement | `Achievement`, `AchievementAward` | `achievements.py` |
| Achievement category | `AchievementCategory` | `achievements.py` |
| Message | `Message`, `MessageCategory`, `MessageLog` | `message_log.py` |
| Engine voice | `EngineVoice`, `EngineReading` | `engine_audio.py` |
| Settings | -- | `settings.py` |
| Speech | -- | `speech.py` |
| States | `State` and subclasses | `states/` |
| Playtest levers | -- | `playtest_levers.py` |

### Roadside colour

Curated flavour data. It has no mechanical effect except where noted, but it is
player-facing text and therefore bound by the vocabulary rules below.

| Concept | Class or catalogue | Module |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Buff | `Buff`, `BUFF_CATALOG` | `data/buffs.py` |
| Brand | `Brand`, `BRANDS` | `data/amenities.py` |
| Billboard | `CORRIDOR_BILLBOARDS` and the roadside sets | `data/billboards.py` |
| Curve | `CurveRecord`, `RouteCurve` | `data/curves.py` |
| Welcome sign | `WELCOME_SIGNS` | `data/state_welcome.py` |

A **buff** is a purchasable consumable -- a shower, a meal, an oil service --
that changes a fatigue, engine or tire accrual rate for a time or for a trip.
Curves are the exception to "no mechanical effect": a `RouteCurve` carries an
advisory speed, and hairpins, sharp and moderate bands have real limits.

**Hairpin** is reserved for a switchback and is spoken about nothing else.
The sharp, moderate and gentle bands come from the advisory speed, but a
hairpin is a SHAPE: the road turns back on itself (135 degrees or more,
MUTCD's Hairpin Curve sign W1-11) and has to be crawled (a Turn sign, 30 mph
or less). A tight corner taken slowly is a **sharp** bend, however slowly.
Spending "hairpin" on ordinary tight corners is what it used to do, and it
left the word meaning nothing when a real switchback arrived (2026-08-23).

### Online

| Concept | Class | Module |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Online identity | `OnlineIdentity`, `OnlinePresence` | `online_presence.py` |
| Journal outbox | `JournalOutbox`, `OutboxItem` | `online_journal.py` |
| Cloud saves | `CloudSaves`, `SyncState` | `cloud_saves.py`, `cloud_save_integrity.py` |

None of these are part of the world model. They project a career or a live trip
outward; nothing in the simulation may depend on them, and every one of them
has to degrade silently when offline.

### The data pipeline

Not classes, but part of the ontology, because the shape is load-bearing:

- Tools edit `src/freight_fate/data/world_source/`, never directly: go through
  `tools/world_source.py`, where `load_world()` returns the whole world as one
  dict and `save_world(data)` writes it back as per-state shards.
- The game loads the indexed `src/freight_fate/data/world_data/` tree.
- `tools/index_world.py` regenerates the index; `--check` verifies the two are
  in sync, and CI and tests expect that.

Both trees shard by the state a leg starts in (`legs/TX.json`), so a one-leg
edit is a small reviewable diff rather than a sixty-megabyte blob. There is no
automatic sync: a source edit that is not re-indexed is a change the game will
never see.

## Spoken vocabulary

The canonical player-facing noun for each concept. This is an accessibility
contract, not a style preference: a screen reader user builds a mental model
from the words, and synonyms cost them a re-read.

Notes on the entries that are not simple:

**"On duty" does double service, and that is a deliberate accepted cost.** It
is already the player's own regulatory duty status -- `sim/hos.rs` speaks
*"on duty, not driving"*, the logbook reads *"Today's totals: driving...,
on duty not driving..."*, and the duty window is *"the 14-hour clock that
starts when you go on duty"* two tables up. *Drivers on duty* uses the same
two words for a different subject: whether somebody ELSE is out working.

Both alternatives were worse. *Drivers board* takes a noun dispatch already
owns, and dispatch's board is the one a player hears about far more often.
*Drivers online* collides with the hub's own name and with the `Online
services` switch, so it reads as "drivers who have online services turned
on" -- close enough to true to mislead. The saving grace is that the HOS
sense the game actually speaks aloud is always the qualified *"on duty, not
driving"*, while bare "on duty" for "currently working" is ordinary English
before it is jargon, and the two never appear in the same screen. If a
tester ever reports confusing the two, this note is the place to start.

**"Standing" is a code word, never a spoken one.** Dispatch trust answers to
three things now -- the service record, the licence, and what the driver owes
-- and the code calls that combination standing (`enforcement.standing_band`).
The game still says *dispatch trust*, because it is one ladder with more
inputs, not a second status. A screen reader user should not have to hold two
words for one question, and "standing" was already ruled out as a synonym
above. `enforcement.standing_text` is a separate thing again: it speaks as
"Record: ...", and it is the enforcement record, not the trust band.

**Say the cause, not the ladder.** Because dispatch trust now has three
inputs, "clean on-time runs rebuild it" is false for a driver whose service is
fine and whose debt is the problem. Every place that says trust is down names
which of the three is holding it and what specifically clears that one.

**Neither ending is an ending.** Ending an employment and taking a truck back
are setbacks with a stated way forward, and the spoken text says so in the
same breath. Never write "game over", "career over", "you failed", "start
over", "bankrupt", or anything implying the save is gone -- none of that is
true, and all of it lands hardest on the player it is describing.

**Job and load are two concepts, not two names.** The job is the contract; the
load is the freight on the trailer. "Use Abandon job to drop the load" is
correct and should stay that way. What is wrong is using "load" for the
contract -- "no load, no pay" means the job.

**"Rig" is flavour, not function.** It never appears in a menu item, prompt,
status readout or warning. It appears in achievement prose, where a second word
for the truck reads as writing rather than as a new concept, and it is the
label of one truck model ("standard rig"). Keep it out of functional text.

**"Corridor" is an explanatory word.** It belongs in help and manual text
describing where the map comes from ("routes made from real highway
corridors"). Per-drive navigation says leg.

**"Device code" is never spoken.** It is the polling secret bound to this
device, not something a player ever reads back or types anywhere -- only the
activation code crosses to the player. Keep it out of every spoken and
transcript-bound string; if a screen reads it out loud, that is a bug.

**The damage bands are three nouns, not three ways of saying "damaged".**
Reduced power is the engine holding back; limp mode is that plus a road-speed
cap the driver cannot drive out of; out of service is the truck no longer being
legal or able to drive at all. Each one means something different is true about
what the truck will do next, so they are never used loosely or
interchangeably. Every readout that gives a damage number gives the band beside
it -- the number alone tells a player nothing about what they have lost.

**"Out of service" is the real-world term and carries its real meaning.** It is
not a colourful way of saying "very damaged": it is the state in which a truck
may not be driven, borrowed from the out-of-service criteria an inspector
applies at the roadside. The same words already name the hours-of-service
version (`_place_out_of_service`), which is correct -- both mean "this truck
does not move until something is put right" -- so never introduce a second
noun for either.

**Grounding is what the carrier does; out of service is what the truck is.** A
company driver hears both, in that order, because they are different facts: the
truck is unfit, and the carrier has taken it off the road as a result.

**Truck damage and load damage are never the same sentence.** The truck's
number is the driver's problem and prices at a garage; the load's is the
customer's and prices at the freight's value, which is far larger. A readout
that gives one must not let the player assume it covers the other, so the Tab
screen names the freight separately from the truck.

**The load's condition is spoken in words first, the number second.**
"Eighteen percent" tells a player nothing about whether the receiver will sign
for it; "damaged, eighteen percent" tells them both. The words are fixed --
secure, shifted but sound, damaged, badly damaged, ruined -- and each one maps
to exactly one thing the dock will do.

**"Roadside rescue" and "roadside repair" are two different call-outs.** The
rescue brings fuel; the repair gets an out-of-service truck moving. They cost
different money and different hours, so they keep different names.

**"Stop" is the most overloaded word in the game** -- the POI, the act of
stopping the truck, and the command to do so. Where the sentence could be read
either way, name the thing: "the truck stop ahead", "bring the truck to a
stop".

**"Buff" is an internal word and must never be spoken.** The catalogue calls
them buffs; the player buys a shower, an energy drink, an Iron Skillet dinner.
Every spoken string goes through `Buff.label`, which is what makes that work.
Game-shop jargon in a trucking sim breaks the fiction and, more practically,
tells a screen reader user nothing about what they just bought.

**The hours clocks are three separate nouns, and they never share a first
word.** "At the wheel" is time already driven this shift, "driving time left"
is what remains of the 11-hour clock, and the "duty window" is the 14-hour one
that can close first. The dedicated keys lead with those nouns so a driver
knows which key landed before any number arrives; "hours left", "hours driven",
and "hours until a break" all open on "hours" and are exactly what not to say.
Hours at the wheel are not "hours on the road" either: the run's clock is a
different number, and a shift can span several runs.

**"Traffic" needs a qualifier.** Simulated vehicles around the truck and
reported incidents on the road ahead are different systems the player can act
on differently. "Traffic is heavy" and "there is a wreck reported ahead" are
not interchangeable.

### "Bear" is CB voice only

"Bear" may appear in exactly one place: inside a clause the line attributes to
the CB, spoken by a driver on the radio. It is trade slang, and it is flavour.
In a warning, a menu item, a status readout, or anything the game says in its
own voice, the word is "trooper".

This is enforced, not just documented:
`tests/test_enforcement_presence.py::test_bear_is_cb_voice_only_in_every_player_facing_string`
scans every player-facing string in `src/` and fails if the word appears
outside a CB clause. The check exists because slang leaks: the word is
evocative, it reads well in a sentence, and one careless line teaches a screen
reader user a second noun for a thing that already had one.

### Driving speech rungs

How much of the road's *information* speaks. Four rungs, cutting whole
categories rather than shortening sentences; the player picks one and the
delivery layer decides per category. "Terse" survives only as the internal
name of the shorter rendering and is no longer a thing the player selects.

| Concept | Canonical spoken noun | Never say | Where |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The working default | standard | normal, default | `DRIVING_SPEECH_MODES` |
| Confirmations and status become sounds | quiet | terse (that is the rendering, not the rung), minimal | `DRIVING_SPEECH_MODES` |
| Safety, cost, and the directions you cannot take back | urgent only | emergency mode, critical only | `DRIVING_SPEECH_MODES` |

Roadside colour -- billboards, place names, landmarks -- is **not** governed
by these rungs. It answers to the chatter switches and the place-callouts
ladder, and a player may run the loudest colour with the quietest rung.

### Terse speech grammar

Terse mode promises: the truck tells you what to *do* and what it *cost*, and
nothing else -- every safety call, route instruction, and money consequence
still speaks, in the shortest form this ontology allows, and everything that
is color, confirmation, coaching, or congratulation is an earcon or silence.
Two rules bound every terse rendering, and the pairs themselves live in
`speech_text.py` (one definition, both forms side by side, pinned by
`tests/test_terse_contract.py`):

**Compress words, never certainty.** A qualifier that changes a decision
survives terse. Parking certainty is the worked example: all five values stay
distinguishable -- "Parking confirmed." / silence (meaning *likely*, exactly
as in normal mode) / "Parking limited." / "No truck parking." / "Parking not
verified." (the spoken form of *unknown*; never "unverified", which would be
a synonym).

**A fixed slot order.** A bare trailing number is only parseable because the
frame never shuffles, so no terse line may reorder its slots:

| Frame | Slots | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hazard-family cue (brake lights, slow traffic) | thing, distance, target speed | "Brake lights, 2.1 miles, 38." |
| Merging traffic cue | thing, distance | "Merging box truck, 0.4 miles." |
| Stop callout | name, exit, distance, qualifier | "Flying J Travel Center Corfu, exit 48A, 5 miles. Parking confirmed." |
| Money consequence | what, amount, who pays | "Toll, 15 dollars, carrier." |
| Speed limit | "Limit", the number | "Limit 65." |

A merging vehicle carries no target speed: it merges behind or passes on
its own, and naming a speed to "be ready for" read as an instruction to
slow down that the situation never asked for. The same rule holds for the
route-merge and construction-taper traffic-pressure advisories
(`Trip._traffic_pressure_message`, GPS_CUE): "Merging traffic in
«distance». Keep «direction»." and "Traffic squeezing at the construction
taper in «distance». Merge «direction» early." carry no speed either. The taper's actual
posted limit is a real sign, not a merge advisory, and is still spoken by
the separate zone warning/entry lines. Exit traffic keeps its speed --
the truck itself is slowing for the ramp, not reacting to someone else's
merge.

**The dodgeable hazard call is "Change lanes or brake!", and it ends by
naming the open lane.** The same phrase the help teaches, followed by the
lane answer in the L key's own words: "Left lane open.", "Right lane open.",
or "Either lane open." (owner, 2026-09-01, on I-90 with adaptive cruise on:
the bare call left a blind driver guessing whether a lane change was even
possible, and the game already knew). The side is read the way a lane change
is refused -- the lane exists, it is not coned off, and nobody is holding it
over the window the change takes -- so the call never names a lane a tap
would refuse. Where nothing is open, on a one-lane road or with both
neighbours held, the call is "Brake!" and ends "No lane open.", and the
hazard is not dodgeable at all. Terse keeps the thing and the lane answer
and drops the opener ("Slow car right ahead. Left lane open."): the named
lane says everything the opener did. "Brake or swerve!" was a terse-only
synonym for the game's most safety-critical cue and is exactly what this
table exists to prevent. The lane change leads the braking (owner,
2026-08-17): both actions stay on offer, because a driver who cannot see the
gap may reasonably prefer to slow, but at a hazard the first word is the one
that gets acted on. Lane changes stay driver-initiated: one tap of the arrow
the call named, with adaptive cruise riding through the dodge.

## Open naming decisions

Recorded rather than silently resolved, because changing any of them changes
what players hear.

- **run against trip.** Delivery summaries say "this run"; the class is `Trip`;
  help text uses both. The table above picks "run" for spoken text and leaves
  `Trip` as the internal name, which is the current majority behaviour rather
  than a decision anyone made.
- **job against load in older strings.** "job" leads roughly four to one across
  `states/`, but some surviving uses of "load" mean the contract, not the
  freight. Those are the ones worth fixing, and only where a player would
  actually hear the ambiguity.
- **`TruckCondition` lives in `models/trucks.py`**, a portable-layer module,
  despite being game-owned save state. It should probably move next to
  `Profile`. Cheap to do, and it removes a boundary exception.
- **One spoken "buff" leak exists.** `states/driving_updates.py` falls back to
  the literal word when a worn-off record has no label:
  `worn.get("label", "buff")`. Every catalogued buff has a label, so it should
  not fire, but if it ever does the player hears "The buff has worn off." A
  better fallback is the group name -- "the coffee", "the tire service" -- or
  saying nothing at all.

## Working rule

- Adding spoken text for an existing concept: use the word in the table.
- Adding a concept: add a row, in the same change.
- Renaming a concept players hear: that is a player-facing change. It needs a
  changelog entry and a note on what they will hear differently.
