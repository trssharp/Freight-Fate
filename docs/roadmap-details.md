# Freight Fate detailed roadmap

[Return to release status and the cutover checklist](../ROADMAP.md).

This document preserves completed work, investigation notes, and pending
backlog items. An unchecked item is still pending. Release decisions and
status are unchanged by the move. Inline file paths are relative to the
repository root; Markdown links are relative to this document.

## 1.9 implementation record and backlog

- [x] **Career 1.9 prerelease builds are complete portable releases
      (2026-08-29).** Each Career 1.9 prerelease build publishes a Windows zip
      and an Apple Silicon Mac app with music and the required audio libraries.
      The Mac app carries SDL2 too, so players do not need Homebrew. The updater
      does not offer this archive on Intel Macs. Career 1.9 copies set to
      `Update channel: developer snapshots` follow newer prereleases with dated
      tags such as `1.9-tester-20260829`, spoken as "1 point 9 tester, August
      29, 2026," while stable players stay on stable releases.
- [ ] **`test_signaling_for_an_exit_eases_cruise_to_ramp_speed` is flaky
      under a full parallel run (seen 2026-08-29)** It failed once in a
      whole-crate `cargo test -p freight-fate`, asserting the brake was on
      approaching the gore, then passed 5 out of 5 on its own and passed the
      next full run unchanged. Nothing in that change touched driving -- it
      renamed menu strings -- so this is the test, not the code. Most likely
      the same class as the jake-line case above: NPC traffic drawn per run
      leaving the truck in a different state at the gore. Diagnose by
      capturing the traffic draw on a failing run rather than by reading the
      cruise code, which is what cost two wrong diagnoses last time.
- [x] **The drivers board keeps itself current while it is open
      (2026-08-29)** It re-checks about once a minute, silently, and holds
      the player's place by DRIVER rather than by row number -- the hazard
      `OnlineSetupState` records, that players build positional memory of
      spoken menus while `refresh()` preserves indices and not identity. The
      list is sorted by name so a change rewrites a line instead of
      reordering under a reader, a driver who signs off under the cursor is
      held and marked until the player arrows away, and a quiet check that
      cannot reach the site leaves the drivers on screen. Matches the
      website's live board, which landed the same day on orinks.net.
      * The endpoint behind it is cached for sixty seconds server-side, so
        the poll cannot usefully go faster without changing that first.
      * Named, 2026-08-29: it is **Drivers on duty** everywhere, and the
        thing itself is a *list*. "Board" stays dispatch's, and "online"
        stays the hub's name and the services switch, both of which it
        collided with. `docs/ontology.md` carries the row and a note on the
        one cost accepted: "on duty" is also the player's own HOS duty
        status, which the game only ever speaks in its qualified form.
      * Not done on the `dev` (Python) line, by owner ruling 2026-08-29:
        1.9 only for now.
- [x] **Driver profiles are readable in the game (2026-09-03).** Enter on
      a driver in Drivers on duty opens `DriverProfileState`: the public
      profile as a spoken list in the online-profile design's order
      (identity, current career, resume, account achievements, road
      journal), one fact per row. The Online hub's new "Your profile" row
      opens the player's own through the same screen. Fed by a new public
      `GET /api/freight-fate/drivers/<driverId>` on orinks.net that wraps
      `getDriverProfile` in the same sixty-second cache as the drivers list
      and trims it to the spoken sections; a hidden profile is a 404 the
      game words as "no public profile", separate from "could not be
      reached". Server side is on orinks-net `dev` (staging); prod gets it
      with the 1.9 cutover, until which the row answers "could not be
      reached" against prod.
      * The stats read are the career fronting that driver's public profile,
        which is the deferred per-career question above, not a new one.
- [x] **The Python gameplay tests are retired; the suite now covers the
      tooling only (2026-08-29)** 223 files mirroring `src/freight_fate/`
      gameplay went, along with the Python adversarial battery the Rust
      `--break-battery` replaced. What stays is the Python that still ships:
      the build, bake, indexing and release tooling under `tools/`, plus the
      workflow and sound-pack guards. 4453 tests in five minutes became 202 in
      six seconds, and gameplay is proved once, in Rust, instead of twice.
      * A gameplay test added on this line belongs in `cargo test`, not here.
- [x] **CI was red or hung on every run for six days before this
      (2026-08-22 to 2026-08-29)** Four independent faults, none of which
      could be seen past the others: a map-wide sweep that grew with the
      city list until it outran the 45 minute ceiling, `cargo fmt` and
      `cargo clippy` drift, a truck-status test still reading a one-shot
      line after the screen became a menu, and the sound-pack pointer
      problem above. Because the Rust job never finished, a traffic-flaky
      jake-line test had also never been seen: it drew NPC traffic per run,
      so the truck sometimes held 20 mph on a one percent downgrade and the
      case failed about two runs in five.
- [x] **The sound pack travels in git instead of Git LFS, and the two weigh
      station verdict tones are in it (2026-08-29)** The pack was an LFS
      object; once the repository's LFS budget ran out a runner checked out a
      132 byte pointer instead of a pack, so the audio tests either failed
      against the pointer or skipped themselves -- a green run that had
      checked no sound at all. At 7.8 MB the pack now lives in git directly.
      * `events/scale_green` and `events/scale_red` were referenced by the
        code and the catalog but were in neither pack, and the release ships
        the COMMITTED pack rather than baking a fresh one, so both tones were
        silent for players. Merged in; the pack is 162 entries.
- [ ] **Re-fetch the 60 sound effects that only exist in the shipped pack.**
      The committed pack cannot be rebuilt on the current builder machine: a
      fresh bake from the loose tree yields 113 entries against the pack's
      162, because 60 ElevenLabs-generated effects (ui, vehicle, weather,
      ambient) are no longer on disk. Until they are restored the pack can
      only be MERGED into, never regenerated -- a plain
      `tools/pack_sounds.py` run would silently drop them. The API quota
      resets 2026-09-06.

- [x] **A missed delivery exit no longer costs the driver the speed warning,
      and no longer promises a recovery that does not exist (2026-08-26)**
      (Tyler Rodick, issue #169, Hattiesburg MS: "it gave me the usual
      dispatch will reroute you message, yet it never rerouted me... it let me
      get up to 89 mph in that zone without anybody saying something").
      One latch, two faults, neither of them local to Hattiesburg -- the
      loop-back itself repositions correctly, proven by driving all five
      approaches into that city plus twelve more cities elsewhere.
      * `update_speeding` returned early on
        `missed_destination_exit_said && !destination_exit_taken`. That was
        right in June 2026, when the method charged silent speeding fines and
        the carve-out spared a recovering driver. Once the fines moved to the
        enforcement watch the method became the DASH, and the same line
        switched the overspeed warning off from the first miss to the dock --
        while the watch, which never read the flag, went on accruing
        over-limit distance. The driver kept the ticket and lost the warning.
        Gone; the warning now runs through the whole loop-back.
      * At the gore, every way of blowing the DESTINATION exit told the driver
        to "stay on the highway and recover at the next safe exit". True for
        an optional stop, false for the destination: there is no later exit
        that reaches the dock, only the scripted turnaround at route end. The
        four lines now name the loop-back the manual has always described.
- [x] **The playtest tools can start you AT the delivery exit --
      `--playtest-road --find destination` (2026-08-26).** Ten finders and
      every one of them mid-route, so the one place both reported
      destination-exit defects lived could only be reached by taking a job
      and driving the whole way, or by guessing a mile with `--at` and
      hearing nothing when the guess was wrong. The new finder asks the
      drive's own scan which interchange it will call the destination exit
      (that ranking is now one free function, `scan_destination_exit`, rather
      than a copy per caller), so the mile the tool promises is the mile the
      game announces. Rural approaches with no signed interchange fall back
      to the synthetic end-of-route exit, which is what those routes really
      have -- Hattiesburg among them. The run-in is derived from the
      callout's own trigger: one `exit_window_mi` plus the tool's standard
      twenty-five real seconds, so the driver has the wheel before the first
      call rather than arriving in the middle of the approach. Covered by
      `playtest_road_destination.rs`, including transcript cases for the call
      and for the loop-back after blowing past it.
      * `--scan` no longer takes the single-instance lock. It answers off the
        world data and returns before any app is built, so refusing it while
        a drive was open cost the tool its one use during a playtest.
      * Both playtest seams now speak the delivery city rather than its map
        key. `road::build_driving` labelled the facility off the pair as
        typed, so `--to hattiesburg_ms_us` put the slug into the opening
        summary, the exit call and the miss line; `start_route` left the
        spoken endpoints empty for the same effect. Closes the follow-up
        recorded above.

- [x] **The CB call you missed can be heard again -- Alt C (2026-08-26)**
      (marrie, issue 156: "a key to repeat the cb chatter I hear from
      the sappy voice... not the chunk chunk of the radio").
      Neither existing replay answered for it. `last_event_message` behind A
      is one slot every non-hazard route announcement overwrites, so a
      landmark or a lane count seconds later takes the CB call away; the
      message log walks by recency, never by topic. `DrivingState`'s
      `last_cb_chatter` is a topic-selected slot holding the newest call and
      the post it was about, written at HANDLE time (like `log_ambient_event`)
      so a line the ambient queue later ages out is still repeatable.
      The repeat re-derives the distance at the truck's position now rather
      than parroting the one it was first heard at, and says "you have passed
      it" once the post is behind -- the same "a rescued line has to still be
      true" rule the hazard, curve and stop callouts carry. Spoken through
      `player_asked`, so the ladder cannot silence it at quiet. Documented in
      F1, in the controls help page, and in `docs/ontology.md`.
      Covered by `states_driving_controls.rs` (six cases) and the keep-right
      nag case in `states_driving_lanes.rs`.
- [ ] **Older CB calls than the newest one are only reachable through the
      message log.** Deliberate for now: CB heads-ups are rationed to
      `CB_CALLS_PER_RUN` so a stepping history would mostly be empty, and a
      second stepping model beside the message log costs a screen reader user
      a second thing to learn. Revisit if the CB budget ever grows.
- [x] **The retarder answers a grade and nothing else, measured across a
      seeded sweep (2026-08-24)** (owner: "on uphill ascents the truck should
      gain speed instead of using the engine brakes", plus "edge cases where
      the jake still activates on flat road with cruise on").
      `crates/freight-fate/tests/it/states_driving_jake_sweep.rs` drives
      eighteen seeded, weather-pinned roads through the real `update_frame`
      path -- descents, sags, crests, rollers, mountain bends, a lead, a
      posted drop, a storm ease, a climb entered hot, and auto mode armed --
      and classifies every retarder frame by which controller held it and what
      the road under the wheels was. Cruise and the curve assist both already
      gated their RAISE on `on_downgrade`; what neither gated was the RELEASE,
      and the third path (AMT auto mode) gated neither.
      * Curve assist: released only when the CORNER ended, never when the
        grade under it did. 6.9 s barking on level road and 4.6 s barking at a
        climb per bend out of a dip. The raise/release decision is now taken
        every frame off `curve_assisting && on_downgrade`, which also subsumes
        the old latch-yield retry.
      * AMT auto mode (J): floored at stage one with no reason recorded
        anywhere, so it kept two cylinders cut for the whole drive and spoke
        every time cruise lifted off the fuel on level road; and it worked to
        the speed it was armed at rather than the number cruise or the keeper
        was holding. It now releases to zero at once on a climb and wherever
        there is nothing to hold, works to the engaged authority's set speed,
        and still snubs a genuine overspeed on level road. New `on_climb`
        predicate in `driving_engine_brake`, on the same two percent line.
      * Off-grade assist retardation across the sweep went from 11.5 s to one
        frame at each grade boundary (the pass the controller already made on
        the old mile). Ten seconds up a four percent climb out of a bend: 29
        mph released against 25 held.
- [x] **"Descent control cannot hold this grade" now means it (2026-08-25)**
      (owner, live I-70 playtest west of Vail: the warning three times inside
      a minute, with the G key answering "Level road. Nothing steep in the
      next 15 miles" in between).
      * The warning was one frame of arithmetic -- `speed > descent_hold_mph()
        + 10` -- and under the "All assists" preset `descent_hold_mph()` is
        `DESCENT_SAFE_MAX_MPH` (55) the moment a downgrade starts. On a 75 mph
        road with cruise set at 80 that sum is true on the FIRST frame of
        every dip, before descent control has acted and while it is about to
        act successfully. Measured on his own seeded route (Silverthorne ->
        Edwards -> Glenwood Springs, seed 4242): eight warnings, every one
        with the drums applied 0.44 to 0.70 and the truck LOSING 3 to 5 mph
        per second, on quarter-mile dips the G key called level 3 s later.
        None of that day's three assist commits caused it; the block dates to
        the Rust port.
      * `DrivingState::descent_is_beaten` now takes the climb side's three
        guards (`CRUISE_GRADE_BEATEN_*`, 2026-07): still over by
        `DESCENT_BEATEN_MPH`, still GAINING, and holding for
        `DESCENT_BEATEN_S` rather than catching one frame.
      * "Still gaining" is `TruckState::net_accel_mph_per_s` against
        `GRADE_HOLDING_MPH_PER_S` -- one copy of the net-force verdict, shared
        with the G readout's "Jake stage N is not holding it" / "Speed in
        hand" branches, so the two cannot contradict each other about one
        moment of road. The readout had its own inline copy and the bare 0.2.
      * `crates/freight-fate/tests/it/states_driving_descent_truth.rs`: the
        owner's own route silent (with the descent control proven to have
        engaged and braked, so silence is not an assist switched off), a
        genuine runaway on faded drums still spoken verbatim, quarter-mile
        dips held with the retarder still down, and a grade sweep in all three
        descent modes where every warned frame is also a frame the G key says
        the speed is getting away.
- [x] **The retarder's line is derived from brake heat, not from a grade
      anybody picked (2026-08-24)** (owner: "the jake activates on every single
      descent it seems, even shallow descent like 1-3 percent... like 6%+.
      That's just a number I threw out there"). Both numbers were guesses. The
      two percent that shipped is `GRADE_WARN_CLEAR_PCT`, the RELEASE edge of
      the spoken grade advisory's hysteresis pair -- a speech constant with no
      brake in it, reused as a control threshold because it made the ordinance
      carve-out agree with the G readout.
      * `on_downgrade` and "may an assist raise the retarder" were one
        predicate and are now two. `on_downgrade` keeps the geometry (the
        hold, the release, the ordinance carve-out, "is a bend's cap the
        grade's doing"). New `DrivingState::retarder_warranted` gates every
        assist RAISE -- cruise's descent staging and the curve assist. Auto
        mode (J) is deliberately untouched: arming it is an explicit choice.
        The pair is hysteresis, so a rolling grade cannot chatter a loud
        device.
      * The rule is FHWA's Grade Severity Rating System criterion -- grade,
        length and gross weight against a drum-temperature ceiling -- evaluated
        on the truck's own heat model: `T_settle = T_ambient + P_brake /
        (C * k(v)) >= brake_fade_onset_c()`. Below that line the drums settle
        cooler than fade and hold the hill at any length; above it only length
        decides when they arrive. Sustained-run filter reuses
        `GRADE_WARN_MIN_RUN_MI`, already calibrated against the baked
        corridors.
      * It is a CURVE IN WEIGHT, not a constant: 4.2% at eighty thousand
        pounds, 4.5% at seventy-one, 5.7% at fifty-five, 9.3% empty, and flat
        in speed (4.14 to 4.27% across 45-70 mph at max gross).
      * Measured, not argued.
        `crates/freight-fate/tests/it/states_driving_jake_line.rs` drives a
        grossed-out truck fifteen minutes down each grade with no retarder
        available and reads the drums: -1% never warms them, -2% 113 degC, -3%
        241, -4% 368, -4.5% 430, -5% 493, -6% 592, against a 400 degC fade
        onset. The drums cross fade between 4 and 4.5 percent, where the
        arithmetic said, and the predicate says yes for exactly the rows that
        cooked. The closed form tracks the simulation to within ~12 degC.
      * The jake sweep gained six shallow-descent roads (1, 2, 3, 5, 7
        percent, ten miles of 3, and a quarter mile of 7) and now reports
        retarder seconds by grade band and by sustained descent length --
        without those roads it could say nothing at all about this report.
        Retarder seconds by band, before against after: 2-3% 33.1 -> 0,
        3-4% 137.3 -> 0, 4-6% 71.0 -> 51.3, 6%+ 250.1 -> 180.6; by length,
        under half a mile 17.5 -> 0 and half to one mile 33.9 -> 0. Total
        491.6 s -> 231.9 s over the same 25 roads.
      * Found while landing it: the curve-assist bench rig never pinned its
        LOAD -- it took whatever cargo `StartDelivery::named` drew for the
        driver name, so once the rule depended on weight, two cases with
        identical roads disagreed about the retarder purely on the name over
        them. Pinned to gross.
- [x] **Rust port: a start with no sound says so (2026-08-26).** Reported on a
      Linux nightly (issue #166): the sound device would not open, the game
      fell back to a silent backend exactly as designed, and the only trace was
      a warning in the session log. A driver who cannot see that log has no way
      to tell a broken sound setup from a broken game. `pick_backend` now
      returns whether the run wanted sound and did not get it -- BASS landing
      on its no-sound device counts, and a run that asked for silence
      (`SDL_AUDIODRIVER=dummy`, headless, a caller-built engine) does not --
      and the main menu speaks it once in the same warning slot the unreadable
      save and lane-keeping notices use. Starting anyway is unchanged.
- [x] **Rust port: macOS builds from source (2026-08-29).** It did not, for
      two reasons a Mac tester hit in a row. `tools/fetch_bass.py` refused to
      run anywhere but Windows, so there was no BASS to load; it now fetches
      un4seen's universal `-osx` build, pinned by sha256, into both
      `macos-x86_64` and `macos-aarch64` (one file, both slices). And SDL2
      linked with a bare `-lSDL2` that never looked in `/opt/homebrew/lib` or
      `/usr/local/lib`, so the link failed with Homebrew's SDL2 installed;
      `freight-fate` first used the `sdl2` crate's `use-pkgconfig` feature to
      find Homebrew's SDL2 -- until 2026-08-30, when Homebrew's `sdl2` turned
      out to be sdl2-compat (an SDL3 shim loaded at runtime) and the tester
      zip died with "failed to load sdl3" on Macs without Homebrew. SDL2 is
      now compiled in statically (`bundled` + `static-link`); a Mac developer
      needs no brewed SDL at all, and the staging step fails any build whose
      executable links SDL dynamically.
- [x] **Rust port: a player-ready macOS app is packaged on a native runner
      (2026-08-29).** The release builder creates `FreightFate.app`, carries
      BASS and Prism inside it (SDL2 is compiled into the executable since
      2026-08-30), audits every bundled binary for dependencies a player's Mac
      cannot satisfy, and ad-hoc signs the whole bundle. Since 2026-08-31 the
      runner also BOOTS the packaged app for five frames (--smoke, dummy
      drivers) -- the hang that forced non-launch verification was the boot
      probes, gone since they moved to worker threads -- so a Mac zip that
      cannot start fails the build instead of shipping. VoiceOver through
      Prism still needs a listening pass on a physical Mac.
- [x] **Rust port: Linux builds, boots on seven distributions, and ships in
      the nightly (2026-09-02).** `tools/fetch_bass.py` now pins un4seen's
      `-linux` x86_64 builds (no AAC add-on exists upstream, as on macOS);
      Prism's Linux library is vendored from the prismatoid 0.17.3
      manylinux wheel with its renamed glib and speech-dispatcher copies
      beside it and a `$ORIGIN` RUNPATH; SDL2 is compiled in statically as
      on macOS, so the executable links nothing but libc, libm, libgcc and
      libdbus-1, and opens X11, Wayland, PulseAudio, PipeWire and ALSA by
      dlopen. The port skeleton's `linux_ships_no_speech_library` test was
      PortkeyDrop's GTK finding copied over; there is no GTK and no second
      glib in this process, and the library loads and picks Speech
      Dispatcher under WSLg with no abort. The release builder stages the
      versioned sonames, refuses a dynamic SDL2 or a payload missing BASS,
      its decoders, or Prism, and the AppImage tool packages the Rust
      staging with `--rust`. `build-career-1.9.yml` gained a
      `build_linux` job on `ubuntu-22.04` (glibc 2.35 floor; fmt, clippy,
      the full suite, `--smoke`, tarball and AppImage) and a `smoke_linux`
      matrix that boots both downloads untouched in bare Ubuntu 22.04 and
      24.04, Debian 12 and 13, Fedora, Arch and openSUSE Tumbleweed
      containers, with Prism really opened and, on Fedora, the tarball
      under Xvfb on SDL's X11 driver. The release requires all of it.
      * Follow-up: **Linux sound needs a usable ALSA default device.** BASS
        on Linux is ALSA-only. On a desktop with PulseAudio or PipeWire the
        `default` PCM is the pulse/pipewire plugin and BASS opens it; where
        that plugin is missing (issue #166's log shows exactly this fallback
        on the Python nightly, and WSLg shows it until `libasound2-plugins`
        and a two-line `~/.asoundrc` route ALSA to Pulse) the game says at
        the main menu that it started without sound. The manual now names
        the package. Worth an in-game hint naming it on Linux specifically.
      * Follow-up: the Linux executable links `libdbus-1.so.3` for the
        Secret Service keyring. Every desktop has it, and the smoke installs
        it into the bare containers; `keyring`'s `vendored` feature would
        compile it in if a player ever turns up without it.
- [x] **Rust port: an ARM64 Linux build for the Blazie BT Speak and BT
      Braille (2026-09-02).** Both notetakers are Linux on a Raspberry Pi
      Compute Module (BT Speak: CM4, Cortex-A72; BT Braille: CM5), so
      aarch64, with a self-voiced text UI and an optional MATE desktop with
      Orca -- Speech Dispatcher either way, which is what Prism speaks
      through on Linux. Nothing new had to be built: un4seen's `-linux`
      archives already carry an `aarch64` slice (now pinned in
      `fetch_bass.py` beside the x86_64 one) and prismatoid 0.17.3
      publishes a `manylinux_2_34_aarch64` wheel, vendored into
      `prism-sys/vendor/linux-aarch64` the same way (RUNPATH repointed to
      `$ORIGIN`, the renamed glib and speech-dispatcher copies beside it);
      SDL2 was already compiled from source. `build_release.py` names the
      tarball `linux-arm64` (matching the Mac archive), `build_appimage.py`
      fetches the aarch64 linuxdeploy and runtime and names the AppImage
      `linux-aarch64` (the AppImage convention), and the updater picks by
      `Architecture` so an ARM64 process is never offered the x86_64
      download or the reverse. `build_linux` is now a two-leg matrix
      (`ubuntu-22.04` and GitHub's hosted `ubuntu-22.04-arm`, the same
      glibc 2.35 floor) and `smoke_linux` boots the ARM64 pair in the same
      containers on `ubuntu-24.04-arm`, minus Arch (no arm64 image on
      Docker Hub). The release requires all four Linux files.
      * Follow-up: **nobody has heard it on a BT Speak yet.** The Debian
        containers on the ARM runner are the nearest stand-in the nightly
        has. Open questions only a device answers: whether the BT Speak's
        ALSA default device is reachable for BASS (the same PulseAudio or
        PipeWire plugin question as any desktop), how the game is launched
        from the self-voiced text UI rather than the MATE desktop, and
        whether Prism finds the device's own Speech Dispatcher or the
        notetaker's self-voicing has to be paused first. Ask a BT Speak
        owner for a session log.
- [x] **Rust port: startup work is not held off the input loop -- FIXED
      2026-08-30.** The Linux report above also had the menu ignore
      arrow keys for the first sixteen seconds, because the speech-backend
      probe and the audio device probe both ran to completion before
      anything pumped events. The speech half went first: `ThreadedSpeech`
      (the Shane-freeze fix, a25d4236) spawns instantly and probes Prism on
      its worker. The audio half followed the same day:
      `AudioEngine::new_deferred` opens the output device on a worker
      thread (`BassBackend::preopen_device`; BASS is process-global, so
      the game-thread build afterwards hits `BASS_ERROR_ALREADY` and is
      instant) while boot runs on the null backend, then `update` swaps
      the real backend in and replays music, volumes and the engine
      voice. A probe that fails arms the silence notice, which the main
      menu now also speaks from `update` when it lands late.
- [x] **Rust port: drive-time frame cost is measured, and one bug found by
      measuring it (2026-08-24).** `crates/freight-fate/tests/it/frame_time.rs`
      drives a seeded, weather-pinned I-70 run out of Denver through the whole
      per-frame path the shipped loop runs (`App::tick` plus the line build)
      and reports mean/median/p95/p99/max, the split between the sim step, the
      rest of the tick and the line build, and what the expensive frames were
      doing. In release the driven frame is **~54 us mean, ~91 us p99** against
      a 16 667 us budget at 60 fps -- 0.3% of the frame, 0 frames over budget
      in 35 618. Before the fix below it was **2 150 us mean**, 13% of the
      budget. Two gates hold it: an absolute one derived from the 60 Hz budget,
      and a machine-independent ratio one asserting a presence string never
      out-costs the simulation.
- [x] **Rust port: the drivers-board line stops cloning the whole radio
      (2026-08-24).** `online_presence_state` resolved the tuned station on
      `self.radio.clone()` -- 757 stations and their identity map, deep-copied
      every frame, 97% of the entire driven frame.
      `RadioState::tuned_station` is the read-only resolve it wanted;
      `current_station` keeps the write-back. Pinned by
      `test_tuned_station_reads_the_dial_without_moving_it`.
- [ ] **Rust port: the frame bench's driver cannot finish a mountain route.**
      `DriveRig::steer` is a throttle and a brake, so on the descent off the
      Divide it works the service brakes down to the low-air warning and the
      spring brakes park the truck at mile 63.5 of 246 -- correct air-system
      behaviour, a bad driver. Teaching it the retarder (or driving it through
      the speed keeper) would take the bench across leg changes and an
      arrival, which are the frames it currently never measures.
- [ ] **Rust port: `App::tick` builds both presence strings every frame.**
      They are handed to services that throttle to seconds, and to services
      that are not running at all unless the player opted in. Cheap now that
      the clone is gone (2.2 us of 54), so left alone deliberately -- but it
      is per-frame work with a per-second consumer, and the first place to
      look if the ratio gate ever starts creeping.

- [x] **Rust port: the adversarial battery is ported, all 45 scenarios
      (2026-08-23).** `tools/playtest_break.py` and its ten scenario families
      are now `crates/freight-fate/src/playtest/break_scenarios/`, run by
      `freightfate --break-battery` and gated by
      `crates/freight-fate/tests/adversarial.rs` -- one `#[test]` per
      scenario, named exactly as the scenario is, `#[ignore]`d for the same
      reason pytest deselects them. Rust has no xfail, so the strict-xfail
      contract is written out: a new ODD fails, a `KNOWN_OPEN` ODD passes with
      its reason printed, and a `KNOWN_OPEN` scenario that comes back CLEAN
      FAILS and says to delete its entry. Two extra guards the Python could
      not have (its parameters came from the live registry): every
      `KNOWN_OPEN` name must be a real scenario, and every registered scenario
      must have a test node.
      The monkeypatches became roads rather than seams. `trip.grade_at =
      lambda: g` is `breaker::force_grade`, which bakes one `GradeSegment` per
      leg of the route the rig is already driving, so `neutral_coast_mountain`
      really does run away down a real 6 percent (109 mph) with the corridor's
      own cities, zones and exits intact. A screen the drive pushes gets its
      `DriveRef` from `Rig::with_drive_on_stack`, and the private `_method()`
      calls Python made go through the menu row that calls them.
      One finding, fixed: the half-mile scale reminder ("Weigh station in half
      a mile. Signal for the scale exit.") was replayed after the truck had
      already been charged for blowing the scale. The port had replaced the
      rescue's validity check -- Python's live `trip.position_mi < scale_mi`
      -- with a wall-clock estimate of when the truck would reach the gore,
      which answers "still ahead" for anyone who speeds up. Now on
      `live::position_mi()`, the same mechanism the red-light line beside it
      already used; `scale_bypass_to_the_end` is the regression gate.
      `short_hop_streak_xp_farming` carried over as the one `KNOWN_OPEN`
      entry, same finding and same reason as the Python list, until
      2026-09-02 (see the short-hop XP bullet in the current section).
- [x] **Rust port: every `valid` gate asks the drive again, not the clock
      (2026-08-23).** All twelve were read against the Python line they came
      from. Four were wrong and are fixed; the hazard call was the one the
      last entry named, and the audit turned up three more of the same shape.
      A spoken line only comes back after an interruption cut it off, and its
      gate is what stops the words returning once the moment has passed --
      so a gate that cannot move is a gate that never refuses.
      * The hazard warning ("Change lanes or brake!") projected its deadline
        onto the wall clock. Python asks whether a hazard is armed at all, so
        it now reads that: dodged or hit, the warning stays down.
      * The curve call took its answer once, when the call was made -- where
        it is true by construction, because a bend is only called while it is
        ahead and the truck is fast. It now reads the truck's mile and speed
        when the rescue fires, so "Sharp left" cannot come back after the
        bend.
      * The destination exit confirmation and the dock hold prompt had no gate
        at all, only a comment saying why they could not have one. "Move right
        for the exit lane" could return past the gore, and "Press Enter to
        continue" could ask again for a press already made -- the two Shane
        reported alongside the scale reminder.
      `live` carries seven facts now (speed, hazard armed, dock menu open are
      the new three), refreshed per frame and at the two places the frame loop
      stops: a hazard clearing mid-frame, and the dock menu taking over.
      Regression gate: seven tests in
      `crates/freight-fate/tests/states_driving_valid_gates.rs` -- one per fix
      for the line that must NOT come back, and one each for the still-true
      case that must. `hazard_ignored_to_100_damage` in the battery now also
      counts warnings spoken after impact.
      The six remaining gates were checked and are faithful: the overspeed
      line, the pull-over demand and its failure-to-stop escalation, the
      collision damage total, the scale's red light, and the green light that
      is deliberately never rescued.
- [x] **Rust port: the open scale notice stops naming a distance it no longer
      has (2026-08-24).** The thirteenth gate, carried over from the Python
      fix that the widened flush rescue exposed. "Open weigh station ahead in
      2.0 miles: ..." had no `valid` at all, so once it became rescuable it
      could be handed back AFTER the half-mile reminder and tell the driver
      the scale was two miles off. Its guard is the line's own words rather
      than a chosen tolerance: it stays true only while the road left still
      speaks as the phrase already spoken, which in Rust means capturing the
      spoken phrase and the unit setting and asking
      `settings::short_distance_text_for` against `live::position_mi()` --
      the settings method's own body, split out so a `'static` gate can reach
      it. Regression gate:
      `test_the_scale_notice_expires_once_the_distance_it_names_is_wrong` in
      `crates/freight-fate/tests/states_driving_enforcement.rs`, verified
      against the unguarded code.

      The Rust battery does NOT reproduce this one. `scale_bypass_to_the_end`
      comes back CLEAN here before and after: the run's rescues land on other
      lines (the route brief, the bypass call, the failure-to-stop warning),
      never on the notice, so the Python battery's three "Signal for the scale
      exit" never appears. The bug was real and live all the same, which the
      regression test shows directly.
- [x] **Rust port: the fair-deadline floor is one-time again (2026-08-24).**
      The fourteenth defect the port has turned up, and a live exploit. A
      mid-trip save written before the deadline model existed gets a one-time
      floor on the delivery deadline when it resumes. Python applied it by
      mutating the very dictionary the career held, so the new deadline and
      its marker landed in the save as a side effect; the Rust `from_snapshot`
      reads a borrowed snapshot -- deliberately, because the pause menu and
      the tests hand it detached copies that must not touch the career -- and
      so left the save untouched. The floor was therefore not one-time at all:
      quit before the next stop save, continue, and it recomputed from the
      hours used by then, handing out fresh deadline on every resume. The
      write-back now belongs to the one caller that owns the profile, the
      resume path in `states/main_menu.rs`, and it saves rather than waiting
      for the next save point, so a session that ends without one cannot
      re-apply the floor at the next launch. Regression gate:
      `test_old_active_trip_gets_deadline_floor_and_model_marker` in
      `crates/freight-fate/tests/states_driving_trip_resume.rs`, which was
      written complete and left failing when the defect was found.
- [x] **Rust settlement keeps unloading outside the delivery appointment
      (2026-08-25).** A receiver's 45-minute live unload advanced the trip
      clock before settlement, so an on-time gate arrival could lose its
      bonus as though receiver service were driving time. Settlement now
      captures check-in before unloading for the deadline and pay while the
      calendar clock still advances through service. The Tyler-to-Payson
      regression carries the reported 19-ton bulk load, assigned long-run
      mid-roof, automatic transmission, 10-hour reset, Mountain Time boundary,
      and spoken settlement verdict entirely through Rust.
- [x] **Rust port: the trooper and enforcement-record cases run (2026-08-24).**
      56 `#[ignore]`d wrong-crate stubs deleted from `ff-core`, where they
      could never run, and rewritten against the real screens: 34 in
      `crates/freight-fate/tests/states_driving_troopers.rs` (the pull-over,
      the roadside ticket, the scale bypass, the unsafe-equipment stop, the
      construction-zone doubling, the compliance tracker and running from a
      stop) and 22 in
      `crates/freight-fate/tests/states_driving_enforcement_record.rs` (the
      serious-violation ladder, the major offense, the fatigue events, the
      pursuit opt-in and the two save-reload exploits). Where Python patched a
      rule, the Rust arranges the real one: the clean-stop leniency case
      searches the actual position-quantised waiver draw for a mile where this
      trip really does roll the wanted side, and panics if none exists rather
      than passing on the wrong one. Neither file found a further defect.
- [ ] **Four more distance-bearing ROUTE lines can be rescued with no guard,
      in BOTH trees.** The audit the scale notice prompted. Each names a
      distance, each queues at ROUTE with `interrupt=False`, and each has a
      later line about the same object that a hand-back would now contradict.
      None is a port divergence -- Python has no gate on any of them either --
      so they want fixing on the Python side and carrying over:
      * `maybe_warn_jake_zone_ahead` -- "No engine brake zone in 3 miles,
        coming into Rochester. Switch the engine brake off before the zone."
        The worst of the four: handed back after the zone starts it offers
        three miles of grace while the fine is already accruing.
      * the exit-lane prep call -- "Exit lane in 1.2 miles. Signal is on;
        steer right for the exit lane and slow to 40." Followed by "Exit lane
        set", which a hand-back would undo.
      * the facility-gate speed warning -- "Facility gate in 0.8 miles. Slow
        to 15." This one starts the gate-miss clock, so it must never be
        dropped; the distance going stale is the separate half.
      * `scale_outranks_rest_planning` -- "Weigh station first: Ontario Scale,
        2.0 miles ahead." The same object as the notice just fixed, so it can
        join the very contradiction chain that fix ended.
- [x] **The destination-exit loop-back tells the truth about who is taking
      the exit (2026-08-26, issue #155).** Full lane keeping takes the
      destination exit with no signal -- documented in the manual, the
      ontology row and the setting's own spoken label. The loop-back after a
      miss did not know it: the normal-verbosity reroute line named the
      take-exit control in every steering mode, where its own terse sibling
      three lines above already guarded on `lane_is_manual()`, and
      `handle_missed_destination_exit` reset every other say-once latch on the
      approach except `lane_keeping_takes_exit_said`. So the second approach
      told an automated driver to press X and then carried no automation
      warning at all. Both fixed in
      `states/driving_events/arrival.rs`; gates are the three
      `test_the_loop_back_*` cases in
      `crates/freight-fate/tests/it/states_driving_destination_exit.rs`,
      verified against the pre-fix code. Not a port divergence -- Python's
      `_handle_missed_destination_exit` has both faults too.
- [ ] **Say who is taking the destination exit in the LAST call, not only
      the first.** The remaining half of #155. Under full lane keeping the
      one "Lane keeping will take this exit" rides the first destination-exit
      callout, which arms as far out as `EXIT_WINDOW_MAX_MI`; every line after
      it -- the countdown anchors in `update_exit_countdown` -- is word for
      word the manual driver's ("Destination exit in half a mile."), which is
      the line that in every other mode means press X now. The only line at
      the gore is the past-tense "You take ... destination exit". Give the
      automated countdown its own tail clause, or move the warning to the
      anchor nearest the ramp.
- [x] **Rust port: a Python-written save verifies here (2026-08-23).**
      A career created and played entirely in the Python 1.9 game loaded in
      the Rust build as "changed outside the game, or copied from another
      computer": the port set `integrity_modified` -- sticky, and carried into
      profile sharing -- and re-signed the file. Python agreed that save was
      validly signed with that install's key; the port's `is_signature_valid`
      did not, on the same bytes.
      The divergence is the READING of the numbers, not the rendering.
      `serde_json`'s default parser takes a fast path that converts the
      significand to f64 before scaling by a power of ten, so a literal past
      fifteen significant digits can land one ulp from what `float()` returns
      for the same text. Six numbers out of the 441 in that 23 kB save moved,
      every one by exactly one ulp: `duty_log` segment 3's `end_hour` and
      segment 4's `start_hour` (both `9.171009505452611` -> `...613`),
      `game_hours`, `hos.non_driving_min`, and the rig's `brake_wear_pct`
      and `engine_wear_pct`. The signature is an HMAC over exactly those
      numbers rendered back to text, so six ulps three bytes apart is a
      different signature and an honest career reads as edited.
      Fixed by turning on serde_json's `float_roundtrip` feature
      workspace-wide, which makes the parser correctly rounded as `float()`
      is. The Rust canonical payload for that save is now byte-identical to
      Python's, all 23,489 of them.
      Pinned against bytes no Rust code produced: `tests/python_signed_save.json`
      is a real career with the driver's name replaced, re-signed by the
      shipped Python `_signature_for` (`tests/gen_python_signed_save.py`), and
      `models::profile::tests_python_fixture` verifies it, loads it through the
      gate, and guards the feature flag itself. All four of its tests fail
      against the pre-fix build. Every earlier signing test signed with Rust
      and verified with Rust, which is why none of them saw this: the port
      agreed with itself perfectly.
      Note for anyone re-testing on a career that already loaded once in a
      Rust build -- it will now pass, because that build re-signed the file in
      the port's own reading. Judge the fix against a save Python wrote and
      Rust has never touched.
      Not done: nothing clears `integrity_modified` once it is set on a save
      on disk, and the load gate cannot tell a false mark from a real one, so
      it must not try. The supported absolution is the existing cloud round
      trip -- back the career up, restore it, and the server grants
      `clearIntegrityFlag` on a signed revision that passed the full gate.
- [x] **Rust port: a failed `DriveRef` borrow is loud now (2026-08-23).**
      `with` / `read` / `call` used to answer `None` for two unrelated
      reasons -- there is no drive, and the drive is already borrowed further
      up the same call stack -- and callers could not tell them apart, so each
      one guessed a plausible default. Two of those guesses reached players:
      the rest stop's fuel row read "Fuel: tank is full" at any tank level,
      because `build_items` held the drive and `fuel_label` reached for it
      again; and calling a roadside mechanic or chaining up from the pause menu
      emptied the pause menu, because those actions rebuilt the rows from
      inside the same borrow. Both were fixed by passing the already-borrowed
      drive in (`fuel_label(ctx, d)`, the shape `tire_label` always had) and by
      rebuilding after the borrow is back.
      The seam itself is fixed now: no drive is still a quiet `None`, but an
      already-borrowed drive trips a `debug_assert!` naming the method and,
      through `#[track_caller]`, the exact call site, and logs a warning in a
      shipped build rather than panicking under a player. Turning it on found a
      third one of the same family immediately: a roadside stop that pulls the
      licence is resolved inside the constructor, while the push helper still
      holds the drive, so `suspended_exit_text` reached for it again and told
      every loaded run "There is no loaded trailer to hand back" with a full
      trailer behind them. Same fix -- the drive is handed in -- and the
      loaded and bobtail halves of that line are both pinned. The seam has its
      own two tests: no drive stays quiet, a nested borrow panics.
- [x] **Rust port: a menu whose rebuild misses the drive keeps its rows
      (2026-08-23).** `RestStopState`, `ParkingFullState`, `PauseMenuState`
      and `FacilityArrivalState` all ended `build_items` with
      `unwrap_or_default()`, so a nested borrow in a shipped build -- loudly
      logged, but with the `debug_assert!` compiled out -- handed a player an
      empty menu, spoken as "No options available.": a dead end at the wheel
      with no way off the screen. All four now go through
      `drive_ref::keep_rows`, which falls back to the rows the menu is already
      holding (`MenuItem` is `Clone`), so the worst case is one stale label,
      recoverable by pressing anything. It also logs the miss, including the
      one the seam's own warning cannot see (a handle whose state is not a
      drive); no drive at all stays quiet, since that empty is legitimate and
      has no rows to keep. One test per screen pins that the way out survives
      the miss. They force the miss through the non-drive handle rather than a
      real nested borrow, because the nested borrow trips the `debug_assert!`
      and ends the test process -- the release path is what they stand in for,
      and the assert has its own `#[should_panic]` test.

- [ ] **Rust port: release built by `tools/build_release.py --rust`**
      (2026-08-22). Stages `build/FreightFate/` -- `FreightFate.exe`, the
      vendored SDL2/BASS/Prism libraries, `freight_fate/data/world.ffdata`
      (the baked container, shipped instead of the JSON tree), both packs,
      `build_info.json`, the docs -- and archives it like the Python build;
      refuses LFS pointer packs, and refuses a payload carrying both the
      container and the JSON it replaced. Measured on the
      `nightly-rustport` build (2026-08-22): the bake takes the shipped data
      from 141,937,342 bytes of JSON to a 7,312,812-byte container, which is
      128 MiB off the staged folder but only 2.8 MiB off the download,
      because the zip was already deflating that JSON to 10.3 MB. `--smoke`
      is wired and the staged build boots and exits 0 on it -- and it is a
      real check: with the container moved aside the same run panics on
      "the shipped world data loads" rather than passing. Left to do: the
      macOS `.app` bundle is now complete; a physical-Mac VoiceOver listening
      pass remains.

- [x] **Rust port: a launch takes the same time every time, and the session
      log says where it goes (2026-08-24).** Three runs of the packaged
      `--smoke` check spanned 1128-2972 ms on identical input; 25 runs put the
      median at 2668 ms with a floor of 676 ms. All of the spread was in the
      quit, not the boot: `DiscordPresence::shutdown` joined its worker with an
      unconditional two-second timeout, and the worker was parked in
      `discord-rich-presence`'s handshake -- a blocking pipe read with no
      timeout, which Discord stops answering for a while when a game is
      launched several times in quick succession. The join could not finish and
      simply charged the player two silent seconds at quit; the same join is on
      the Settings, Online toggle, so turning Discord status off froze the game
      the same way. `Inner::wait_for_worker` now waits only when the worker
      holds a live client to hand back, and a handshake that lands after the
      stop flag is torn down instead of re-showing a presence the player has
      already quit. 30 runs after: median 690 ms, min 656, max 922 on a
      quiet machine; median 774, max 1525 with another build running
      alongside, and that spread is the whole boot moving together rather
      than any one phase -- `quit: rich presence` reads 0 ms even on the
      1525.
      `app::boot_timing` marks every seam of the launch and the quit into
      `logs/game.log` as `phase:` lines, which is how the two seconds were
      found and how the next stall will be. Warm packaged phase table: SDL
      window 293 ms, `--smoke` data checks 171 ms, controller subsystem 89 ms,
      the quit-time profile save 68 ms, BASS and its four plugins 17 ms, first
      frame 14 ms, everything else at or under 3 ms. Not addressed: the SDL
      window and the controller subsystem are 380 ms of the 660, both genuinely
      needed before the first frame.

- [x] **Windows shutdown never waits on the desktop window manager
      (2026-09-01).** A tester log showed saves, services, controller, audio,
      and speech all finishing promptly, followed by 22.3 seconds inside the
      window phase. The earlier shutdown fix skipped SDL destruction but still
      called SDL's synchronous hide operation first. Windows now receives an
      asynchronous hide request through the native window handle, and the
      process leaves final SDL cleanup to the operating system. Other platforms
      retain normal SDL shutdown.

- [x] **Rust port: quitting writes no career save and waits on no cloud
      backup (2026-09-01).** Jessie's log put 0.7 seconds in the quit-time
      save and 2.3 more in the cloud upload it queued, then quit waited on
      that upload. Every exit from the terminal (Escape, "Quit to main menu")
      already saves and says so, a drive saves only at a stop, and the title
      has nothing new, so the quit save only rewrote a matching file. Removed:
      quit now writes settings alone. The window's close button at the
      terminal was the one exit that skipped the terminal's own save, so its
      confirmation now saves the way Escape does. Pinned by two tests in
      `tests/it/states_main_menu.rs`: quitting from the title leaves the save
      file alone through shutdown, and closing the window at the terminal
      saves before it quits.

- [x] **Rust port: a test run can no longer open a real web browser
      (2026-08-24).** The driver setup page opened in the owner's browser
      while the suite was running. Opening a page went through one seam whose
      DEFAULT was the real browser: a test that installed no stand-in got a
      live page, and Report a problem did not even go through the seam -- it
      called the browser library directly. The seam is also per thread, so a
      page opened from a worker thread was never covered by a stand-in
      installed on the test's own thread. Reversed: reaching a browser is now
      a capability `main()` grants and nothing else does, so a test process
      cannot have it; an unseamed open records the address and fails the test
      by name. Report a problem goes through the same door. Proved by
      `tests/it/browser_guard.rs`, including from a spawned thread, and
      verified failing first against a build with the old default. The game
      is unchanged: the verification page and the bug-report form still open.

- [ ] **Rust port: three more outside-world seams still default to the real
      thing.** Same shape as the browser was, found while fixing it. The
      orinks.net transport (`online_transport`), the driver-identity store
      (`identity_store`) and the thread's save directory are all per-thread
      overrides whose default is the live network, the platform keyring and
      the player's real save folder. Nothing in the suite reaches any of
      them today -- measured, by refusing every one and re-running: zero
      keyring calls, and the only live HTTP is below -- but each is one
      forgotten stand-in or one spawned worker away from doing so, and a
      spawned worker gets the REAL save folder because the pin is per
      thread. The services every test app builds carry the live transport by
      default and are only held back by having no driver identity to send.

- [ ] **Rust port: the test suite calls api.weather.gov for real.** Eleven
      requests in one run of the integration suite, from the live-weather
      worker threads on the Chicago, Gary and Indianapolis routes. Refusing
      them changes a driving test's spoken result
      (`test_destination_exit_response_queues_behind_intervening_safety_cue`),
      so at least one case is quietly reading the actual weather over
      Chicago. Give the weather provider a stand-in in the test rig.

- [x] **Rust port: the update check reaches api.github.com during boot
      (2026-08-24, by design, recorded because nothing said so).** Measured,
      not read: with the DNS cache cleared, one packaged `--smoke` run leaves
      exactly one new entry, `api.github.com`, and a TCP connection to
      140.82.113.6:443 is open for the rest of the run. `MainMenuState::enter`
      arms `UpdateChecker::new`, which is a detached thread, so it never
      delays the first frame (measured at 3 ms after the menu is built) and
      never delays the quit. It fires in `--smoke` and in a
      `--playtest-sandbox` session too, because both boot into the main menu
      and both are frozen builds. The sandbox isolates the driver identity,
      so no orinks.net traffic happens; GitHub is the one host a sandboxed
      session still touches, and `tools/playtest_watch.py` will report it.
      Decide whether a sandboxed session should skip the update check.

- [x] **Rust port: the packaged game opens no console window (2026-08-23).**
      The port had no `windows_subsystem` attribute anywhere, so the binary
      linked into the console subsystem and Windows gave every launch a
      terminal beside the game -- measured live on the `nightly-rustport`
      tester build, whose running process owned a real console window. The
      Python build never did this (`--windows-console-mode=disable`).
      `crates/freight-fate/src/main.rs` now carries
      `#![cfg_attr(windows, windows_subsystem = "windows")]`, and the drive
      tools get their output back from `AttachConsole(ATTACH_PARENT_PROCESS)`
      at the top of `main`, taken only when the command line carries at least
      one argument, so a player's launch is attached to nothing at all.
      Two measured traps are handled: a GUI-subsystem process starts with NO
      standard handles on every shell tested (so an un-attached tool run
      prints into the void), and `AttachConsole` OVERWRITES the standard
      handles that `cmd.exe` gave a redirected child, which sent
      `freightfate --break-battery > out.txt` to the terminal and left the
      file empty until the attach began restoring them. Verified in the
      packaged build: `--help`, `--list-break-scenarios`, `--smoke` and a
      redirected `--break-scenario ... --transcript` all print and exit 0
      from a terminal, from `cmd.exe` redirection, from a pipe and from
      `subprocess.run`; a no-argument launch has no console and no `conhost`
      child. Pinned by `crates/freight-fate/tests/windows_subsystem.rs`,
      which reads the `Subsystem` field out of the built binary's PE header.
      Known gap, in PowerShell only: `FreightFate.exe ... > out.txt` writes
      an empty file, because PowerShell does not wait for a GUI-subsystem
      process and closes the pipe under it. `| Set-Content out.txt`,
      `cmd /c`, a bash shell and `Start-Process -Wait` all work. Left to do
      only if that bites: a second console-subsystem binary in the workspace
      for the drive tools.

- [x] **Rust CI trimmed to the per-push set (2026-09-02).** A push took
      twelve minutes: six compiling the workspace crates on the hosted
      Windows runner, four running tests, the rest clippy and setup, in
      one job. Now clippy is a parallel job with its own cache; the test
      job passes `--cfg ci_quick`, which ignores the sixteen whole-map
      sweeps in the game crate (state lines, facility exits, destination
      kinds, traffic rate, retarder benches) and the twelve job-board
      shards in ff-core -- as much run time as the other 2,400 tests
      together; sccache keeps an unchanged ff-core from recompiling;
      Defender is excluded from the build tree; BASS comes from the
      Actions cache; and the build's `cargo-timing.html` is uploaded on
      every run. The sweeps still run nightly on the Career 1.9 snapshot,
      on a manual dispatch, and in every local `cargo test`.
      * Found on the way: the smoke test and the deadhead speed-control
        case failed two runs in three since the yard load landed
        (2026-09-02), because the dispatch board rolled from OS entropy and
        a load staged in the home yard opens the shipping office instead of
        the deadhead those two need. The test app now seeds every board it
        builds (`GameContext::dispatch_board_seed`, `None` in the game), and
        a rig whose subject is the deadhead declines a yard load the way it
        already declined a reposition.
      * Measured on the runner, warm (run 33654550607): 6 m 44 s end to
        end against 12 m before. Clippy 1 m 45 s in parallel; the test job
        3 m 56 s of build and 1 m 47 s of tests. sccache hit all five
        library compiles and refuses every `--test` binary (crate type),
        so the build is now bounded by two units that compile the whole
        crate a second time with `cfg(test)`: ff-core's unit-test binary
        (216 s) and the game crate's `it` binary (183 s), with the game
        crate's own unit-test binary (102 s, for 80 tests) alongside.
        Test profile at opt-level 1 (run 33655640563, warm rerun): 6 m 23 s
        end to end, build 3 m 30 s, tests 1 m 52 s. That is the hosted
        Windows floor for this shape of suite; the next real step is either
        the unit-test move below or a self-hosted runner, where the same
        build takes under a minute on a desktop.
      * Follow-up: the game crate's 80 unit tests cost a full second
        compile of an 89k-line crate on every push; the ones that do not
        need private items belong in `tests/it/`, and the rest could sit
        behind one small `#[cfg(test)]` seam, so that unit exists no more.
      * Follow-up: `codegen-units` for the test profile has not been
        measured on the runner; the timing report is uploaded on every
        run, so the next person can try 16 against the default 256.
      * Follow-up: run the ff-core and freight-fate test binaries
        concurrently once the build is done (cargo runs them one after
        another), worth about half a minute on the runner.

- [x] **Rust port: CI (`.github/workflows/rust.yml`, 2026-08-22).**
      `cargo fmt --all --check` on Linux, then `cargo clippy --all-targets
      --locked -D warnings`, `cargo test -p ff-core` and
      `cargo test -p freight-fate` on Windows, with the same headless trio
      the Python jobs use. Windows only: SDL2 is vendored for windows-x86_64
      alone. macOS (since 2026-08-29) and Linux (since 2026-09-02) build from
      source with BASS fetched and Prism vendored, and are covered by the
      nightly snapshot workflow rather than this per-push one.

      **The Rust job follows the same LFS rule as the Python one, and must
      keep following it (2026-08-23).** It first checked out with `lfs: true`,
      taking roughly 270 MB per push, 261 MB of that music.pak. Both runs on
      the port branch then died at CHECKOUT with "This repository exceeded its
      LFS budget" and the test job never ran a test. The two workflows share
      one budget, so half a fix is no fix: this job now checks out with
      `lfs: false` and pulls sounds.pak alone (7.5 MB, what the suite actually
      reaches for), non-fatally, exactly as `ci.yml` does. DO NOT PUT
      `lfs: true` BACK.

      The original argument for fetching everything was that
      `test_committed_pack_has_freight_fate_header` and
      `test_committed_music_pack_has_freight_fate_header` guard with "if the
      file does not exist, skip", and a pointer is a file that EXISTS -- so
      the guard never fired and the byte-length assertion ran against 130
      bytes of pointer text. That is fixed rather than worked around:
      `ff_core::assets_pack::pack_available` / `is_lfs_pointer` tell a pointer
      from a pack, and every Rust test that reads the shipped bytes now skips
      on a pointer with a note on the log naming it -- the two committed-pack
      header tests, the shipped-recording lookups and durations in
      `audio_backends.rs` (nineteen of them now take the recordings through
      `bass_rig_with_recordings`, which wants BASS *and* the bytes), the horn
      stream in `audio_loops.rs`, `verify_sound_assets` in
      `audio_sound_pack.rs`, and the music-catalog sweeps in
      `audio_backends.rs` and `audio_speech_audio.rs`. The note is not
      decoration: a green run that quietly tested no audio at all is the
      failure this guards against, and the same red window the Python side is
      riding out (allowance resets on the 1st) hides a real failure just as
      well here. Read the job log, not the badge.

      NEVER VERIFY THIS BY MOVING OR STUBBING THE REAL PACKS. The working
      tree holds the only copy of a 250 MB Git LFS object, and an attempt to
      swap one out for a pointer during this work truncated music.pak to zero
      -- recovered from the local LFS object cache, but it need not have
      been. `FREIGHT_FATE_PACK_DIR` exists for exactly this: point it at a
      throwaway directory holding pointer stubs and the whole lookup follows,
      with the shipped packs never touched. That is how this was checked --
      `cargo test -p freight-fate audio` under a pointer-stub pack directory
      against the same run with the real packs. The predicate itself is
      pinned in committed unit tests that build their pointer in a
      `tempfile::TempDir` (`test_an_lfs_pointer_is_not_an_available_pack`,
      `test_a_real_pack_and_a_missing_one_are_both_read_correctly`), so the
      trap stays covered without any file being moved at all.

- [x] **Rust port: the validator invariants export has a shipped code path
      (`ff-invariants`, 2026-08-22).** The Rust half of
      `tools/export_profile_integrity_invariants.py`, argument for argument
      (`<output>`, `--check`): `CatalogInputs::current()` assembles the
      export from the live catalogs -- achievements, the XP and level
      curves, start options, truck and upgrade prices, the profile and
      career field lists, the endorsement and fleet-tier tables, and the
      condition record `fresh_condition()` actually writes -- and the binary
      renders it. Before this, nothing in the tree built a `CatalogInputs`
      from the shipped catalogs at all; the only caller was a test fixture,
      so four of the ported tests were measuring the fixture rather than the
      game. The two exporters now produce byte-identical JSON, pinned
      against a committed copy of the Python output in
      `crates/ff-core/tests/profile_integrity_export.rs`. Left to do: wire
      the export (or its `--check`) into `tools/build_release.py --rust` and
      the Rust CI job, so a balance pass that moves a curve cannot ship
      before orinks.net has the new file.

- [ ] **Clean the workspace for the new gates.** Both fail on `ff-core`
      alone today, before `freight-fate` is even reached.
      `cargo fmt --all` fixes 74 hunks across 11 files (weather, timezones,
      hos and real_traffic tests, save_migration, start_options, trucks,
      and three `tests/data_*.rs`) that are pure line-wrapping drift.
      `cargo clippy -p ff-core --all-targets -- -D warnings` then reports
      six: `field_reassign_with_default` at `cargo_condition.rs:391` and
      `:524` and `sim/weather/tests.rs:1187`, `manual_is_multiple_of` at
      `pyfmt.rs:180`, `filter_next` (use `rfind`) at
      `profile_integrity_invariants.rs:642`, and `type_complexity` at
      `sim/real_weather/tests.rs:725`.
- [ ] **The audio tests only run where the packs are.** CI checks out without
      LFS -- the repository's LFS budget is spent, and an exhausted quota
      refuses the 7.5 MB `sounds.pak` fetch just as firmly as the 250 MB
      music one -- so the 45 tests that need real audio content now skip
      there instead of failing against a 130 byte pointer. They still run in
      full on any clone with the packs materialised. Until the budget is
      restored or the packs move off LFS, nothing in CI actually exercises
      the decode path; a periodic job that fetches with LFS and runs just
      those tests would close the gap without paying per push.

- [ ] **The facility engine toggle speaks uncategorised.** At the quiet
      speech rung, switching the engine off on the road gives an earcon
      (`driving_controls.py` passes `SpeechCategory.CONFIRMATION`), but the
      same action in the facility menu (`driving_core._toggle_facility_engine`)
      still speaks "Engine off." in full -- it calls `ctx.say` with no
      category. Found while pinning the ladder test to the file that owns
      each line; left alone because it changes what a player hears and wants
      its own entry.

- [x] **Real time driving mode (owner, 2026-08-22).** The Driving mode row
      is Relaxed, Standard, Real time: `TIME_SCALES` gains 1.0, the tuning
      table gives it standard's pressure field for field (a clock, not a
      difficulty -- what the retired Realistic should have been), and the
      label is the same "real time" the Traffic source row already speaks.
      `Trip.effective_time_scale` keeps the parked 2x fast-forward for the
      compressed pacings only; at 1x the wall clock is the promise, parked
      included. Mid-drive switching needed no new wiring: the driving loop
      already re-reads `settings.time_scale` every frame and the pause menu
      opens the full Settings tree. Breaks and sleep still jump the clock
      through `_advance_rest_clock`, so nobody sits through a ten-hour rest.
      Real time now anchors the independent player-facing calendar to the
      computer's date and time at drive start and when selected mid-drive.
      A session-only sub-day offset keeps that alignment without moving elapsed
      career time, delivery time remaining, or hours of service.
      Tests: row cycle and Left/Right walk, tuning equality, 1x rolling and
      parked, settings round-trip of 1.0 without migration.

- [x] **Ramp-terminal fallback weights calibrated against the bake**
      (2026-08-20). 8,205 of 18,011 baked interchanges carry a READ control
      from OSM; the split is 88.7/11.3 signal-to-stop within URBAN_RADIUS_MI
      of a route city and 64.3/35.7 outside it. The seeded fallback asserted
      70/25 and 30/50, so rural ramps got roughly twice the stop signs
      reality carries. Now 84.3/10.7 and 51.4/28.6 -- the signal:stop ratio
      is read, the free-flow share is still assumed and says so.

- [x] **Ramp far-end road class baked from walked link topology**
      (2026-08-20). The bake walks every exit's motorway_link chains from the
      gore: 597 exits whose every chain merges back onto a motorway now carry
      an explicit `ramp_control: none` (derived, and the source string says
      from what), and 14,897 exits with a chain that touches a surface road
      carry `ramp_far_end: surface`, which SUPPRESSES the runtime's via-signage
      free-flow guess -- via points where the exit is signed toward, not at the
      road the ramp lands on, and walked topology disagreed with it on 27.5%
      of the 15,494 exits it could judge. The walk stops at crossroad nodes
      (link nodes shared with a vehicular non-motorway way; footpaths
      excluded), a toll booth on the chain vetoes free flow, and a chain
      ending on a trunk stays conservative. Unjudged: 2,504 exits with no gore
      in range, 13 with no verdict; those keep the old via guess plus dice.

- [x] **Terminal controls read at the walked terminal node** (2026-08-20).
      Controls are read within 120 m of the node where the walk says the
      ramp actually ends -- including signals mapped per-approach on the
      crossroad way, which link-membership could never see -- instead of
      anywhere in a 1.4-2 km circle around the exit. Result across the
      world: 7,387 terminal-precise reads (275 of them corrected a
      different exit-wide read), 277 exit-wide fallback reads remaining on
      exits the walk could not judge, and every one of the 213
      signal-at-a-proven-merge contradictions resolved -- the neighbor's
      control dropped, the merge baked. Proven merges rose to 597.
      1,387 exits end at a give-way or roundabout terminal: baked as
      `yield`/`roundabout` on 2026-08-20 once the cross-bubble yield below
      shipped (precedence within a terminal's kinds: signal, then
      roundabout, then stop, then give-way).

- [x] **Yield as a ramp-terminal control, on real cross traffic** (design
      settled with the owner 2026-08-20; cross bubble + yield terminal +
      stop/signal clear calls shipped 2026-08-20). What shipped:
      `sim/cross_traffic.py` simulates the crossroad per controlled
      terminal -- seeded Poisson arrivals per side at design-constant rates
      keyed to control kind and near-city (the crossroad's own AADT is not
      baked yet; when it is, the rates should read it), platooning under a
      braking-invariant following envelope, cross traffic queuing on the
      player's green and flowing on the red, per-vehicle crossing cues
      panned to their ear with class-specific timing. The stop sign's
      "Clear; pull ahead" waits for a real gap and names the nearest
      crosser; yield/roundabout terminals announce, judge the roll-through
      at the line, and the assist rolls a clear yield and holds for an
      occupied one; violations meet what the bubble actually holds (hit /
      forced gap / empty road) instead of scripted certainty. Remaining
      slices, deliberately deferred:
      - [ ] Lead-car yielding (the car ahead on the ramp runs the same gap
            acceptance and sometimes stops dead -- the rear-end setup).
      - [ ] Crossroad AADT baked per terminal so arrival rates become
            read/derived instead of design constants.
      Rural diamonds and roundabout
      terminals are commonly yield-controlled; the game only knows
      signal/stop/none, so those exits dice into lights and stop signs that
      do not exist there. The mechanism is the CROSS BUBBLE, the mainline
      traffic bubble rotated 90 degrees: when a terminal announces, a short
      simulated stretch of crossroad spawns real TrafficVehicle entities
      (AADT-seeded at the edges, simulated after that) driving through the
      conflict point. They platoon behind slow cars -- the real burst-then-gap
      rhythm -- react to a player nosing into the window (brake, horn, or a
      clip at THEIR closing speed), and pan/loudness come from simulated
      position, so finding the gap is a listening skill. Owner's call, and
      right: scripted audio sweeps were considered and rejected -- cross
      traffic must be NPCs. The same bubble upgrades all three existing
      terminals: cross traffic runs the orthogonal signal phase (you hear why
      you are waiting, and the green is audible as the cross stream dying),
      and the stop sign's unconditional "Clear; pull ahead" starts waiting
      for a real gap. Yield rules: roll through at 15 or under in a gap;
      stopping is always legal; crossing an occupied window is the clip
      machinery. Roundabout terminals fold into yield v1 (US entry conflicts
      left-only), spoken as a roundabout. The car ahead on the ramp runs the
      same gap acceptance, so it sometimes stops dead at a busy yield -- the
      classic rear-end setup, spoken by the following-gap machinery. Assist
      slows to roll speed and only stops for an occupied window. Ontology
      row for the yield in the same change. Build order: terminal-precision
      read above (with give_way/roundabout) -> cross bubble + yield terminal
      -> lead-car yielding -> stop/signal clear calls adopt the bubble.
      Mainline merge symmetry (NPCs yielding to the player from on-ramps)
      stays out of scope with the parked merge-yield AI feel item.

- [x] **Destination approach assistance brings the truck to a stop at the
      arrival point.** Shipped 2026-08-20 after three failed attempts, all
      of which passed a test built on stand-in objects while the real game
      drove past the market. The distance it steers by is the ramp countdown
      (`_ramp_mi`), not `trip.remaining_miles`, which measures the route end
      and reads over three miles with the truck yards from the gate. The run-in
      down a destination ramp now also holds the real clock (`Trip.dock_run_in`),
      the way a ramp ending in a light or a sign already did -- compression was
      eating the last 560 feet in a single frame, so no braking profile could
      have fitted. Its test drives a real App down a real ramp with the ramp
      terminal cleared, because the stop-sign assist was hiding the failure.
      Re-fixed 2026-08-22 (Jerry, Hobbs): the stop profile aimed at rest AT
      the point, which is exact only for a truck whose sole retarder is the
      brake; rolling resistance, drag, grade and the servo's release band all
      took more off, and an undershooting profile converges on a stop SHORT
      of the point -- nine metres short on the bench, throttle forced to
      zero, dock never opening. The profile now aims at a walk
      (`ARRIVAL_CREEP_MPH`) at the point, asks the brake only for the share
      the road is not already taking, holds the walk on the throttle over the
      last lengths, and lets the point's own full brake land it. Pinned end
      to end on the real harness -- level, uphill, downhill, from the top of
      the ramp, and on a street chain uphill -- by "the dock opened", not
      "the truck stopped", because the latter passed with the truck parked
      32 metres short.

- [x] **Facility stopping assistance goes from the ramp-end signal to the
      entrance, hands off (owner ruling, 2026-09-01).** An agent drive from
      Chicago to Gary found the gap: the ramp assist stopped the truck at the
      sign, the cab said "Clear; pull ahead to the entrance", and the truck
      sat at idle until the driver drove the last stretch to where the
      arrival assist took the pedals again. The terminal release now names
      the assist ("Facility stopping assistance is taking you to the
      entrance") and arms `approach_pull_ahead`. A plain ramp was already
      driven by the arrival latch from the bar; its "taking the pedals" line
      is skipped when the release named it. A street-chain ramp, which the
      arrival assist refuses, now runs the truck up to the ramp's posted
      limit from the bar to the ramp's end (owner, same day: "speed up to
      the limit to get to that point as efficiently as it can" -- the first
      cut walked it at the 12 mph facility-lane roll; the pedal ceiling is
      `APPROACH_ROLL_THROTTLE_MAX`), and `begin_surface_chain` hands the streets to
      the speed keeper explicitly (announced, "K or braking cancels"), the
      way the acceleration lane is handed to it on the way out; the arrival
      latch at the gate and the "holding at the entrance, press Enter" hold
      are unchanged. The driver's brake (Down / B) cancels the pull-ahead
      beside the cruise rule in the frame loop and holds the cancel for that
      ramp; a driver on the throttle is never fought. With the keeper off, a
      chain facility keeps the manual release, because the promise could not
      be kept. Three harness drives pin it: hands off from the sign to the
      entrance hold on a chain facility, the unchanged manual release with
      the assist off, and the brake cancel on both facility shapes.

- [x] **Facility stopping assistance walked a whole ramp at 12 mph (owner,
      2026-09-03) -- FIXED same day.** The arrival latch held a flat
      `FACILITY_LANE_ROLL_MPH` from wherever it fired to the final creep
      stretch. On a ramp with no terminal control (`ramp_control == "none"`:
      every scale ramp, a freeway-to-freeway ramp, or the dice) the
      `facility_final_approach` bypass latches at the TOP of the ramp, so the
      truck crawled the entire `RAMP_LENGTH_MI` at 12 with the lane posted
      at 15 or more. Second edge: `loop_back_to_destination_terminal` reset
      the pull-ahead but not `destination_arrival_active`, so the retry after
      a blown gate was held at the walk from the turnaround on and the
      "announces itself again" the comment promised never happened. The
      hold is now `facility_lane_hold_mph`: the lane's own number (posted
      limit, never above the ramp advisory) brought down on the comfort
      profile to the gate creep, floored at 12; a truck over the lane number
      is lifted and left to drag the way the ramp cap already does. Two
      bench lessons from Shelby's downgrade ramp on the way: a lane hold on
      a grade that pushes the truck is kept on the brake that balances the
      grade, eased with the shortfall and never dropped outright (dropped,
      it re-applied every other frame, 7 psi a half-second, spring brakes a
      third of a mile short); and under the shed the brake eases to zero a
      little under the profile instead of letting go at it, so the pedal is
      continuous and a truck well under the profile is driven up to it. The
      loop-back lets the latch go. Pinned by a scale-ramp unit test (throttle, not
      brake, 3 mph under the lane number with 0.4 mi left; brake 30 over),
      a loop-back latch test, and a plain-ramp sign release on the harness
      reaching past the old walk before the dock opens.

- [x] **There is no way to back a career up on demand (Brandon, 2026-08-15)
      -- FIXED 2026-09-01.** "Back up this career now" is the first action
      on each career's Cloud backup screen whenever a save for it exists on
      this computer and no conflict is recorded (under a conflict the two
      keep-this-copy rows own the upload). It runs the queue's own
      `backup_now` and speaks the result in the Save game wording: backed
      up, already backed up, the conflict rows, reconnect needed, the
      career-named rejection story, or "has not gone through yet" with the
      queue still trying. Not added to the Online menu: that menu is
      switches and account state, and one place to do a thing is what a
      screen-reader player can remember. The row is named in
      `docs/ontology.md`. Name, placement and wording are the recommended
      calls of 2026-09-01, applied so the nightly carries the row; easy to
      rename before the next build if the owner wants different words.
      A career can only travel upward two ways: the background queue after a
      save, and "Keep this computer's save and back it up" -- which
      `CloudSlotState.build_items` only offers while a conflict is RECORDED.
      No conflict, no upload control anywhere in the game. Brandon fell
      through that hole twice in one evening: first the conflict blocked the
      queue, and then, once he had resolved it by restoring, the button that
      could have sent his own newer career up vanished with the conflict that
      summoned it. He lost level 4 and 3,294 dollars back to the cloud's
      level 3 -- recoverable only because a restore leaves the replaced file
      as `.ffsave.bak`, which nothing tells the player. Wanted: a plain "Back
      up this career now" on the Cloud backup menu, always present, using the
      same upload path, so a stuck queue is never the player's only hope.
      Deliberately not added unattended at 1am -- it is a new control on a
      shipping menu and wants a canonical name in `docs/ontology.md`, a
      decision about whether it appears on the Online menu too, and its own
      spoken result.
- [x] **The driving event voice did not survive a restart (MariahL via
      Mastodon, 2026-09-02) -- FIXED 2026-09-02.** Choosing Windows OneCore
      on the Driving event voice row saved to disk, then came back as SAPI
      next launch; the tester's workaround was to choose it again and touch
      another setting. `apply_speech_settings` re-read "which event voice is
      bound" straight after queueing the switch, and the threaded sink
      answers that from a snapshot still describing the voice bound BEFORE
      the switch, so the stale name overwrote the fresh choice in memory and
      the quit-time settings save put it on disk. The substitute for a voice
      that is not on this machine is now decided from the option list (the
      same fallback `select_event_backend` makes) and the sink's read-back is
      never written to settings. Pinned by a test that uses the full-voice
      capture, which offers OneCore but reports SAPI, exactly the lagging
      answer.
- [x] **"<career> is backed up" every save is a lot on a long run (MariahL,
      2026-09-02) -- DONE 2026-09-02.** New Speech row, "Say when a career
      is backed up: every time / once a session / never". The owner's
      2026-08-15 default (every accepted upload speaks) is unchanged; once
      a session speaks each career's first all-clear after launch; never is
      silent. Refusals and the "backed up again" recovery line speak at every
      tier, because a career silently stopping backing up is the failure the
      all-clear exists to rule out. Stored as `backup_announcements`, read by
      the cloud queue at startup and on every step of the row.
- [x] **Playing from a braille display with speech off (AppleVis ask,
      2026-09-02) -- DONE 2026-09-02.** Prism already had the primitive
      (a `supports_braille` feature bit and a braille-only entry point on
      NVDA and JAWS) and the main channel already used `output`, speech
      plus braille, so menus reached a display; but nothing ever called
      braille alone, and driving events went to SAPI, which has no display.
      New Speech row, "Output: speech and braille / braille only", stored as
      `braille_only` and pushed through `apply_speech_settings`. With it on,
      `Speech::say` calls the main voice's `braille` instead of `output`,
      and `say_event` routes to the same display instead of the event
      voice. Honoured only while the bound voice can braille: any other
      voice keeps speaking and the row says so after the announcement; a
      display call that fails is spoken and logged; a screen reader that
      quits mid-drive hands speech to SAPI and the display comes back with
      it (the flag lives on the `Speech` object, not the backend, like the
      rate and voice config). Pinned in `tests/it/speech.rs`.
      - [ ] Pacing on a display: NVDA shows a braille message for its
            configured timeout and the next one replaces it, so a burst of
            road cues leaves only the last readable. The event pacer still
            governs braille-only delivery with its speech timing model,
            which is roughly right but not tuned for a display; a
            braille-only playtest by a display user is what settles whether
            the timing needs its own rung.
- [x] **The verbosity pass over every spoken line (owner, 2026-09-02) --
      DONE 2026-09-02.** Asked for by braille display readers: the help
      screens, settings descriptions, ramp and exit cues, arrival and rest
      stop menus, city screens and the ff-core message pairs all said the
      fact and then coached the driver through it. The pass keeps the WHERE
      (at the bar, at the end of the ramp, at the entrance: the lines that
      grew because a playtester stopped a quarter mile short) and every
      value and decision-changing qualifier, and drops the HOW and the
      explanation. Terse renderings and their slot grammar are untouched.
      Pinned expectations moved with the text.
      - [ ] A display reader's playtest is what settles whether the
            standard rung is now short enough, or whether braille only
            should default to the quiet rung.
- [x] **Short-hop XP: the battery's last known-open finding, closed
      (2026-09-02).** `short_hop_streak_xp_farming` had reported 25-mile
      hops at 4.6x a 500-mile haul's XP per mile since the Python line, and
      sat in `KNOWN_OPEN` because the remaining gap is the flat completion
      award, kept by design on 2026-08-12. The owner took the recommendation
      to keep that design: the flat lesson is what lets a rookie's short
      hauls move the career, the honest pacing model's shortest deal is 105
      miles so the arc to level 30 is untouched, and the scenario's miles
      proxy overstates the edge because every hop costs a full dispatch and
      dock cycle of real time. The scenario now holds the bar the design
      actually sets -- no hop earns more than its flat lesson plus twice its
      road lesson, and ten hops' XP beyond their flat lessons stays within
      twice a long haul's per mile (1.7x with the streak cap; removing the
      cap puts it over 2x) -- and `KNOWN_OPEN` is empty for the first time.
- [x] **Say when other drivers go on or off duty (Josh, 2026-09-02) -- DONE
      2026-09-02.** New Online menu row, off by default, stored as
      `duty_notifications`. A background watch (`duty_watch`) reads the
      public drivers list once a minute (the site's cache period) while the
      row and online services are on, seeds silently on its first answer,
      skips the player's own id, and queues one line per read ("Night Owl is
      on duty. Road Star went off duty.") that the loop speaks queued, never
      interrupting. An unreachable read keeps the last known set. The
      Drivers on duty screen lost its Refresh row in the same change: it
      already re-checked itself every minute, and a failed answer retries
      on the same clock.
- [ ] **A staged limit drop should be taken in stages (Shane, 2026-08-15).**
      Approaching roadwork the truck hears "speed limit 55 miles per hour,
      then construction zone 45" and then sheds straight to 45, never
      pausing at 55. His words: it "should slow to 55 then when before the
      work zone it should slow to 45 instead of diving right down to 45".
      The world model is NOT at fault and needs no change -- `trip.py`
      already lays a `construction merge` zone at
      `CONSTRUCTION_TAPER_LIMIT_MPH` (55) over the taper mile, then the
      `construction` zone at 45, and `speed_limit_at` returns the right
      number for each. The keeper's cap is right too: it comes down with the
      limit under the wheels. The culprit is the ease-ahead,
      `_keeper_ease_target` (`driving_events.py`), which picks the LOWEST
      limit in its lookahead window and sheds toward it, so an intermediate
      posted number inside that window is skipped rather than held. Fix
      shape: ease to the NEXT limit boundary, then re-target, so the truck
      steps down the way the sign sequence and the announcement both
      describe. Deliberately NOT done unattended -- it changes assist
      behaviour on the approach to a work zone, and the spoken promise and
      the enforcement numbers have to be re-checked together against the
      harness, not reasoned about. Owner request 2026-08-15:
      with the lane work yours, taking an exit means holding a position at
      the right of the lane, and that position was the one thing on the road
      a blind driver could not hear. Holding a steering direction now starts
      the lane locator's own panned tock without the I key, for as long as
      the move lasts; an armed exit takes it over from the moment the driver
      moves across, quickens the beat as the position fills, and stops it
      with `vehicle/signal_tone` played centred and quiet -- the signal
      cancelling itself -- the instant the exit lane is set. No new speech,
      silent under full lane keeping and below the locator's speed floor,
      and held on the audio clock's dead man's switch so a menu over the
      drive ends it in silence. See `_update_steering_lane_cue`.
- [x] **Debt payoff from cash -- SHIPPED.** Whenever a driver carries a
      balance and has money in hand, the terminal and every truck stop now
      offer to pay it down: all of it, half, or everything above a 200
      dollar fuel cushion. Clearing the balance stops settlement collection
      on the spot.
- [x] **Truck dealer is a direct terminal menu item -- SHIPPED.** The
      city-service drive is retired; the dealer now opens straight from the
      terminal menu, named for the real local dealership where one is on
      record. Fuel, repairs, rest, and food stay at truck stops and the
      terminal garage. See the amendment on "Local city service drives"
      below.
- [x] **Settings menu reorganized (Variant B) -- SHIPPED.** Gameplay is now a
      category that opens its own submenu of four shorter, spoken screens:
      Driving assistance, Difficulty and hours of service, World and traffic,
      and Controls. The weather/traffic/parking sources and the live-weather
      calendar moved out of Speech and weather (now "Speech") into World and
      traffic; enforcement presence moved to World and traffic too. The dead
      "Lane keeping" pointer stub in old Gameplay is gone, and the duplicate
      speed keeper row is collapsed to exactly one. A one-shot
      `settings_version` migration line tells a returning player where things
      moved the first time they open Gameplay; a fresh install hears nothing.
      A reachability test guards against orphaning any setting in the split.
- [x] **Settings audit -- SHIPPED 2026-08-15.** A field-by-field sweep of all
      73 `Settings` fields for consumers found nothing dead: every field
      either reached the game or was genuine internal migration machinery,
      so the audit itself was a reorganization and an honesty pass rather
      than a deletion (the one field that did come out, below, was removed
      for behaving wrongly, not for being unread). The speed
      keeper moved from Controls into Driving assistance; "Lane and edge cue
      prominence" became "Lane and edge cue volume" and moved to Audio under
      the Gameplay cues volume it scales, with quieter/standard/louder values;
      every saved key stayed identical, so no choice reset. The layout-notice
      flag became a per-version `settings_layout_notice_from`, so future menu
      moves need no new field and a player two layouts behind hears both.
      `test_no_settings_field_is_a_phantom` now fails any field with no
      consumer outside `settings.py` and the settings menu, with commented
      allow-lists separating internal flags from pending features. The one
      real removal came out of the audit rather than into it: the overspeed
      warning armed at 5 over, exactly the pace `ACC_LIMIT_OFFSET_MPH` makes
      predictive cruise hold, so it chimed at drivers for the truck's own
      speed and the setting existed only to silence it. It now arms at 7 --
      above cruise's pace, below `OBSERVE_LEEWAY_MPH`'s 9 -- and the
      `overspeed_warning` setting is gone (owner ruling 2026-08-15).
- [ ] **Lane centering assistance is still a promise, not a feature.**
      `lane_centering_assist` is a real settings row the presets write, and
      nothing in the driving code reads it; the help text now says so plainly
      instead of describing steering help that never arrives. Either
      implement the steering help or retire the row before 1.9 ships.
- [x] **Headless-measured startup: four fixes for ~0.46s off the
      launch-to-main-menu path -- SHIPPED 2026-08-12.** A profiling pass
      pinned headless startup at a 2.166s median and isolated four
      independent costs: the sound engine now kicks the ~225MB sound pack's
      read-and-unmask onto a background thread as early as `App()`
      construction starts, so it overlaps the world load instead of
      stalling the first sound played (measured ~0.32-0.34s off the first
      menu sound at both 0 and 20 saved careers); the main menu's save-scan
      (`_loadable_saves()`) ran three times on every menu entry and now
      runs once and reuses the result (measured ~0.11s saved at 20 saved
      careers, scales with save count); `keyring` and
      `cryptography.hazmat` (pulled in by the online-account and
      cloud-backup modules) are now imported lazily, on first real use,
      instead of on every launch whether or not the player has ever linked
      an account (~0.15s measured import-time saving); and a frozen build
      now bakes its package version into `build_info.json` at build time
      instead of scanning installed-package metadata on every launch (dev
      checkouts are unaffected -- no measurable local win, this only pays
      off in a packaged build). Measured on the same headless phase-timer
      the profiling pass used, 5 runs each: 2.187s to 1.727s median with an
      empty save collection, 1.887s to 1.682s with 20. One thing considered
      and deliberately left alone: skipping `OnlineIdentity.load()`
      entirely when every online setting is off would have shaved a
      further ~0.065s for players with a linked account, but
      `OnlinePresence.set_enabled()`/`CloudSaves` both refuse to turn back
      on without an identity already loaded, and nothing re-loads it when a
      setting is flipped on mid-session outside the account-link flow -- so
      a player who linked an account and then turned every online setting
      off would have lost the ability to turn one back on without
      re-pasting credentials. Left unconditional; the load already costs
      nothing for the common case of no linked account, via the existing
      early return before it ever touches `keyring`. The remaining big
      item, sharding/streaming the world load itself (~1.17s of the
      median, by far the largest single phase), is a separate, larger
      change and out of scope here -- tracked as its own follow-up, owner
      approved, in the bullet immediately below.
- [x] **World load, the largest single startup phase, cut by ~0.82s via
      lazy per-leg corridor loading -- SHIPPED 2026-08-12.** `World.load`
      measured 1.207s median and built every leg's heavy per-mile detail
      (grades, interchanges, landmarks, state crossings, checkpoints, toll
      events, speed limits, traffic volumes, restrictions, lane segments,
      elevation, route points) for all fifty states up front, plus the
      ~31MB of nationwide local-driving data (facility approaches/endpoints,
      surface-street geometry, city services) -- almost none of it touched
      in a session. Legs are now `LazyLeg`: only the fields the route graph
      and dispatch read stay eager, and dispatch-completeness is baked at
      load from raw corridor counts (byte-identical to the old
      `metadata_complete`, since those five fields parse one-for-one) so the
      route graph never triggers a parse. The heavy tuples build once, via a
      non-data descriptor, the first time a leg is driven, then cache on the
      instance for zero per-access cost. The nationwide local data is loaded
      lazily on first facility/city-service query. Measured on the same
      phase-timer, 3 runs: `World.load` 1.207s to 0.390s; route-graph
      dispatch work 0.0014s; first-leg-drive materialization 0.29 ms/leg
      (imperceptible); first facility-approach local-data hit ~85ms, once
      per category. The frozen build benefits equally -- the baked path runs
      the same lazy `World.__init__`. Deferred, not needed: the ~0.30s JSON
      parse itself is untouched; sharding/streaming that is a separate,
      larger change if it ever proves worth it.
- [x] **First round of Dropbox tester findings triaged and fixed --
      SHIPPED 2026-08-11.** Three P0s off the tester living document
      (Shane P). A construction zone could close the only lane on a
      one-lane stretch, pinning the driver in the closed lane and
      re-running the barrel collision until they quit -- placement now
      requires two lanes across the whole footprint including the taper,
      and the merge check stands down when there is no open lane.
      Taking a weigh station's own exit ramp counted as bypassing it,
      because the bypass test ran a frame before the ramp existed and
      judged on speed alone. A paid roadside fine was re-charged on every
      reload, escalating each time, because the armed stop was saved but
      never re-saved on resolution -- this also fixed the same
      double-charge for speeding tickets. Owner-operator careers now
      start with a brand-new truck (owner design call, same date) instead
      of one already damaged and short of fuel, and driving through work
      zone barrels is now a 1,000 dollar serious violation.
- [x] **The two driver assists that manufactured violations -- SHIPPED
      2026-08-11** on `fix/assist-behaviour`. The speed keeper had no
      lookahead at all: it read the limit under the wheels while every
      forward-looking input the game owns is wired only into cruise,
      which refuses to engage on facility streets. The 20 it could not
      reach is not a posted limit either, it is the trailer corner cap on
      any 25 mph street -- so this was a turn advisory, and a
      posted-limit lookahead alone would not have fixed it. Worse than
      speeding: the keeper drove into the missed turn, charged 8 game
      minutes for the loop-back, and then cancelled its own session. The
      curve assist raised the retarder on any curve it handled with no
      test of how much speed the corner needed -- 53 engagements across
      811 miles of real curve data, ten on one route for a 7 mph
      sweeper. Both now measured, not assumed: keeper deceleration
      benched at ~0.4 m/s2 at street speed, and a plain jake threshold
      was caught cooking the drums past fade onset in 4.5 minutes on a 6
      percent grade, so real downgrades are carved out.
- [x] **Automatic emergency braking left no reaction window -- SHIPPED
      2026-08-11** (Munchkinbear, 2026-08-11: "less than half a second
      between being told to brake/change lanes and the truck slamming on
      the emergency brakes"). The hazard deadline was braking budget plus
      a fixed slack, while the assist engaged at 1.2x the budget plus half
      a second -- so the driver's window was a remainder, and every reason
      the truck stops badly (speed, downgrade, brake heat, wear, grip)
      came out of the driver's time rather than the truck's. Measured on
      the traffic warning at 65 mph: 0.52 s fresh, 0.02 s drowsy, negative
      (engaging on the first frame) on hot brakes or in the wet. It got
      worse this build because putting traffic back on the road made that
      warning -- the tightest slack the game emits, and a dodgeable one,
      which budgets the longer stop -- the common case. The deadline is
      now built forward from the moment the assist must act, so the window
      is a guarantee: 3 s minimum to hear the warning and get on the
      pedal, plus 2.5 s more when the call offers a lane change, since
      that is how long the move takes. A tap change already under way
      holds the assist off while it can still beat the hazard.
- [x] **The assist did not always stop in time -- SHIPPED 2026-08-11**
      (owner question the same day: to help a player it should stop in
      time). It applied full SERVICE braking and the budget sizing its
      engage point assumed the same, but the predicted stop gets slower
      while it happens as the drums heat under that application. Benched
      from the moment of engagement across nine conditions, two collided
      after "Emergency braking engaged.": 65 mph on 450 C drums, 40 pct
      wear and grip 0.7 down a six percent grade, and the same downgrade
      at 80. `AEB_BUDGET_MARGIN` was meant to cover this and is not enough
      when every factor compounds. Service braking stays the first answer;
      once the time left no longer covers even that, the assist uses the
      hardest stop the rig has. All nine now clear. Deliberately a last
      resort, with a test each way -- an ordinary hazard on good brakes
      must not become a spring-brake panic stop.
- [x] **Enforcement forgot every look it deferred -- SHIPPED 2026-08-11**
      (Jerry, 2026-08-11: whole routes over the limit with nothing
      happening). One demand on the driver at a time is the right rule, so a
      post whose watch overlapped a hazard, a ramp or a pull-over had its
      look deferred -- into `_deferred_post_ids`, a set written in one place
      and read in none. "Defer, never drop" therefore held only while the
      post still covered the truck's mile, and a hazard window outlasts a
      one-mile radar reach several times over at any pacing. The look is now
      TAKEN when it happens and held until the cab is quiet, with a five-mile
      staleness bound so a trooper who never caught up loses you. The old
      test asserted the id landed in the set, which pinned the bookkeeping
      and not the behaviour; it is replaced by two that drive the truck past
      the post first.
- [x] **Hairpins on ordinary roads, off the mountains -- SHIPPED
      2026-08-11.** The 2026-08-09 screen was gated on flat terrain alone,
      so 385 hairpin-severity curves survived on US and state routes (296 in
      hills, 89 in mountain). Two more discriminators, both measured before
      they were applied: city-departure geometry within 2.5 miles of a leg's
      city node on non-mountain ground (112 curves, including a 43 ft kink a
      mile out of Hazard on KY-80), and a 50 ft radius floor for any road
      class (4 more, the tightest a 41 ft bend on US-50). The floor sits just
      under the tightest genuine switchback in the data, US-550's 54 ft at
      mile 60.5. Across the whole world the three screens together flag
      nothing in mountain terrain -- the property to check first if these
      thresholds are ever moved. KY-80 is the precision case: the hills kink
      at mile 1.06 goes, the mountain switchback at 2.48 stays.
- [x] **The posted limit flickered under time compression -- SHIPPED
      2026-08-11.** OSM splits a way wherever any tag changes, so the baked
      maxspeed profile carried postings a few hundred feet long. Real driving
      hides them; at 20x they go by in under a second, and the player hears
      the limit reduce and normalize with nothing on the road to explain it.
      Measured before the fix: 23 percent of all posted changes on three long
      routes were segments crossed in under three real seconds, including an
      80 to 45 to 80 inside 1.2 seconds on the Sheridan-Merced run. Length
      alone could not be the test -- the median village posting in this world
      runs seven tenths of a mile -- so a short posting survives when a
      village within a mile explains the REDUCTION, and goes when nothing
      does. World-wide: 829 of 1,287 legs changed, posted segments 15,206 to
      11,207, sub-second postings 1,993 to 583, drop-and-restore blips 1,415
      to 309.
- [x] **...and still flickered, because the bar was written in miles --
      SHIPPED 2026-08-12** (owner, on the 2026-08-11 build: "I still see
      speed decreases and increases a few seconds after one another"). Two
      holes. The mile bar is not one experience: a mile at 70 is 2.8 real
      seconds at standard pace and a mile at 30 is over ten, so a 1.0 mi bar
      admitted multi-second flickers by construction (40 of them). Worse, the
      village exception was an unconditional pass -- any reduction within a
      mile of a place survived at any length, which is how a quarter-mile
      80-to-75-to-80 on I-44 lived through the screen. That accounted for 763
      of the 803 postings still crossed in under three real seconds.
      The dwell is real seconds now (`LIMIT_DWELL_REAL_S`), converted to
      miles at each posting's own speed through the same compression ramp
      `effective_time_scale` uses, and the exception is a halved bar for a
      drop to a town speed rather than a free pass. World-wide: posted
      segments 11,207 to 7,401, postings under three real seconds 803 to 0,
      drop-and-restore blips under six seconds 703 to 120 -- and every one of
      those 120 is a town speed beside a village the game speaks aloud, which
      `test_no_leg_in_the_world_flickers_its_posted_limit` now pins as a
      property of the shipped map. Sized on the standard 20x pace: relaxed
      gets a quieter road than it strictly needs, and realistic is the player
      asking for the world to fly by. The data layer carries its own copy of
      the pacing constants (it never imports the sim); `test_maxspeed` pins
      them to `trip_models` so they cannot drift.
      Knock-on, fixed in the same change: Strawberry's 35 was one of the
      slivers, and `_village_explains_drop` only looked FORWARD for the drop
      a village explains, so the rim town stopped being sparse-worthy and
      went unspoken on the default place-callouts tier. A name now also
      explains the town speed already under the wheels when the road opens
      back up just past it.
- [x] **The alpha test book ships with the build -- SHIPPED 2026-08-11**,
      as `ALPHA_TEST_BOOK.md` plus an HTML rendering, verified by
      `verify_packaged_payload` like the manual. Its checklists are written
      against particular builds, so a tester fetching the current copy from
      the repo could easily work an old one. New sections cover the three
      2026-08-11 fixes: the hazard reaction window (4.2a), deferred
      enforcement looks (7.3a), and the curve/limit map fixes (11.1a).
- [x] **Date badges read the clock nobody sees -- SHIPPED 2026-08-11**
      (owner report: April's Fool firing with the real-time calendar on,
      in August). A career carries two clocks: raw `game_hours`, which is
      elapsed career time, and the calendar the player is actually told --
      the real wall-clock date when live weather drives it, otherwise
      career time plus `calendar_offset_days`. Every spoken surface used
      the second; `_award_arrival_achievements` used the first, so
      `april_first` fired on career day 11 whatever the date really was,
      and `christmas_delivery`, `new_year_run`, `friday_thirteenth`,
      `winter_delivery`, `four_seasons` and `desert_summer` were all wrong
      the same way -- a delivery could count as a winter run while the
      live weather said summer. The two-clock choice now lives in one
      accessor, `season.player_calendar_hours`, which the terminal's Time
      and weather readout uses as well; it was the duplicated inline
      expression that let them drift apart. Testers who already earned a
      date badge out of season keep it -- revoking earned badges would be
      the worse call.
- [ ] **New Dropbox tester findings, reported 2026-08-13 -- triaged
      2026-09-01.** (1) Sarah: on a road with more than three lanes the
      lane-change callout says "middle lane" for both the middle and the
      left, and there is no way to tell the far-right lane on a five-lane
      road; she also heard a contradictory "right lane open, left lane
      open" once (Indio to Riverside). The double "middle" was FIXED
      2026-08-19 as a side effect of `MAX_DRIVABLE_LANES`: the driver is
      never placed on more than three lanes your side, so every lane has
      its own name again. STILL OPEN, by design for now: a four- or
      five-lane road is driven as three, so the far-right lane of a
      five-lane freeway does not exist to the truck. Lifting the cap needs
      a fourth and fifth spoken name ("the second lane from the right") in
      every lane sentence, and a row in `docs/ontology.md`.
      (2) Shane: enforcement and passing-cop sounds cut off the in-cab
      radio -- a game-SFX-over-radio mix issue, distinct from the
      speech-over-engine ducking setting shipped this round. OPEN.
      (3) Shane: on a one-lane road a cop still tries to pass -- FIXED
      2026-09-01, see the one-lane bullet under Radio and traffic.
- [x] **"Lane open" survives time compression -- landed 2026-08-13**
      (Jerry: "it said the right lane was open... I move over and I hit a
      vehicle"). The clearance read behind the lane-open cue and the L
      readout was a static window around the truck, widened by a 0.12-mile
      margin meant to buy the driver reaction time -- but traffic moves on
      compressed game time, so at 20x a cruise at 65 closing on slowed
      traffic at 38 ate that margin in under one real second and half a
      mile of gap before the 2.5-second drift landed. His log shows both
      sideswipes 4.5 real seconds after an honest "Right lane open."
      `vehicle_in_lane` now sweeps each vehicle's relative motion over the
      seconds the driver needs (hear the line, react, drift across),
      converted through `effective_time_scale`, so a lane being closed on
      -- ahead or from behind -- is never called open. The sweep test in
      `test_lane_return_gap.py` now advances the world between the readout
      and the arrival, which is the case the old same-instant test could
      not see.
- [x] **Classic engine voice restored to the original recording --
      2026-08-13.** The Settings engine-voice "classic" option quietly
      became the rebuilt idle cut played the old way when the licensed
      overlay landed 2026-07-27: both voices shared the engine/idle key,
      and the overlay owns that key. The donated 1.8.x idle now ships
      in-repo under its own key (engine_classic/idle, gitignore
      carve-out) that no overlay can shadow, the BASS classic path asks
      for it first and logs an honest fallback, and `*.bak` files no
      longer ride into the pack (the shipped pack carries one beside the
      real 1600 jake).
- [x] **Sounds.pak repacked for the classic voice -- 2026-08-13.** 278
      to 279 entries, rebuilt from the shipped pack's own contents (not
      a builder tree, so every 2026-08 addition survives): adds
      engine_classic/idle.ogg, renames the stray
      jake_1600.synth-original.wav.bak to an honest
      engine/jake_1600_synth.wav so both 1600 jake cuts ship and a
      future synth-versus-recorded jake toggle is a pure code change.
      Length/SHA pins updated. build_release verifies the classic cut
      is in any staged pack.
- [x] **Jake voice A/B -- 2026-08-14.** Settings, Audio now carries an
      Engine brake voice row (recorded/classic) right after Engine voice,
      same live-flip pattern, default recorded. The routing lives at
      key resolution in `audio.py` (`AudioEngine._voice_key`), so both
      the drive and Learn game sounds demo whichever voice is chosen
      without either call site knowing the A/B exists. Provenance on
      the recorded 1600 (f737b416) is still accepted-on-word; OWED: the
      recordist's name from Josh for a CREDITS.md row. If provenance
      sours, the classic option is already wired as the fallback.
- [x] **Sealed-cab transfer on the engine voice -- 2026-08-13.** The
      "engine sounds external" complaint was a missing cabin transfer
      function, not the voice. cab_filter.py applies the owner-approved
      sealed variant (from the sound-test/cab_transfer.py auditions;
      runtime output verified byte-identical to the approved render) to
      the five band cuts at load: -16 dB shelf past 1 kHz, 2.4 kHz
      lowpass, +5 dB body, 63 Hz boom, 1.7/3.3 ms early reflections,
      RMS-matched, circular so loops stay seamless. Classic voice and
      jake deliberately untouched this round.
- [x] **Shift gap no longer reads as the engine cutting out -- 2026-09-03.**
      Testers heard the engine die on every gear change. The shift itself
      was already the licensed clunk bank at both ends; the cut-out was the
      bed between them: the disengage duck stacked on the load cap put the
      gap 11 dB under full load and 7.5 dB under plain coasting, and a
      downshift held that for its full one-second interrupt. Bounded by the
      game's own model now (a torque interrupt is an unloaded engine, so the
      gap sits 2 dB under the off-throttle bed); the test pins the gap
      within 3 dB of coasting. Owner's ear still rules on the exact level.
- [x] **Automated shifts rev-match in both directions -- 2026-09-03.**
      Through the interrupt the engine now heads for the NEW gear's
      synchronous speed (a fueled blip up on a downshift, an engine-brake
      assisted fall on an upshift) at the rate its spare torque over its
      rotating inertia allows, and holds there, so the gear takes on a
      matched engine instead of jumping. The blip rate is each truck's own
      (torque, engine brake); the interrupt LENGTH is still the
      transmission's owner-tuned timer, deliberately: the one-second
      downshift is what keeps a jake descent from cycling the retarder
      fast enough to break a chained truck loose (physics bench). Inertia,
      motoring drag and rev-match fueling are ASSUMED figures, labelled so
      in `sim/vehicle.rs`.
- [ ] **Shift length from the engine, not a timer.** With the trajectory
      in place, the interrupt could end when the engine reaches sync plus
      an actuator floor, capped by today's timers. Needs the jake-descent
      bench re-run first: shorter downshifts double the preselect cycle.
- [ ] **Per-truck gearboxes.** Every model drives one ten-speed ratio set
      and one final drive. Realistic shifting across the yard means each
      model carrying its own box: gear count and ratios, final drive, and
      type (automated manual versus torque-converter automatic, which has
      no torque gap at all). Touches the truck catalog, saves, the
      ten-speed auto-shift thresholds, manual gear keys and spoken gear
      names. Owner chose the rev-match first, this deferred (2026-09-03).
- [ ] **Cabin-state intensities for the cab transfer.** The moderate
      variant from the same auditions is the natural "window cracked"
      setting; wire intensity selection to the doors/windows mechanic
      when the cabin-audio immersion work lands (2.0 line). Adjust the
      sealed parameters from tester feedback -- they are constants in
      cab_filter.py, not baked assets.
- [ ] **Cab-transfer review follow-ups (merge review, 2026-08-13).** The
      classic fallback on a pre-classic pack now routes the rebuilt idle
      through the seal and then pitches it -- a third voice neither
      setting promises; resolve the classic key once per process instead
      of re-probing and re-warning every ignition. The seal applies only
      to bands that resolve as wav, so an ogg band cut silently skips it
      with no log -- make "sealed" a property of the key, not the file
      extension. Pre-warm the five band seals during the loading screen
      (first ignition currently pays ~160 ms of FFT on the game loop).
      The sealed parameters and biquad math are duplicated between
      cab_filter.py and sound-test/cab_transfer.py -- the audition
      script should import them so tester-feedback tweaks cannot desync
      the lab from the ship. The pygame backend has no classic path, so
      the Settings toggle no-ops there against the changelog's promise.
      Builder trees that still hold jake_1600.synth-original.wav.bak
      must rename it to jake_1600_synth.wav (done on the primary
      builder 2026-08-13) or the next pack_sounds.py run drops the
      synth jake cut.
- [x] **Pedal latch yields to the speed authorities -- landed 2026-08-13**
      (Brandon latched the throttle for the whole trip expecting the
      assists to drive; every assist read the latch as a manual override
      and stood down). A latched throttle is now the lowest-priority
      speed input: cruise, the speed keeper, and curve assist own the
      pedal while engaged and the latch ramps back in when they release,
      with no re-gesture. Hand-held keys keep manual-override meaning;
      releasing the latch never cancels an assist; the catch line names
      the authority holding the speed. Spec:
      `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-13-pedal-latch-assists-design.md`.
- [x] **Cruise steps snap to the fives; Ctrl steps by one -- landed
      2026-08-13** (Jerry's latch-and-race-K workaround for catching an
      even 35; Sarah's real-stalk snapping). Plain plus/minus walks the
      fives grid from wherever K captured the target, healing off-grid
      speeds in one tap; Ctrl with the same keys moves by exactly 1 mph
      (Ctrl, not Shift -- the main-row plus IS Shift+equals). Pad cruise
      buttons stay coarse. Spec:
      `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-13-cruise-step-snapping-design.md`.
- [x] **Road events breathe; radio contours last -- landed 2026-08-13**
      (owner: back-to-back events in every mode; most of the 5,700-station
      dial living in fringe). Kept the clock -- career pacing is balanced
      on it -- and spaced the three routine talkers (limit arrivals,
      traffic calls, zone colour) with real-seconds gaps at the source,
      self-superseding so only current state ever speaks; big unannounced
      limit drops cut in line. Radio: clean program through ~85% of the
      contour (was ~52%) and a 2x reach multiplier for compression, smear
      ruling intact at the true edge. Spec:
      `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-13-event-pacing-radio-reach-design.md`.
- [x] **Station identity content generated and wired in -- landed
      2026-08-14.** All 19 stations now have a real host (8 clips each), 3
      station IDs (2 sung jingles and a spoken legal ID), and a shared pool
      of 18 fictional ads for the road: travel centers, diners, tire shops,
      and more. The Roadhouse got a new host voice, and Night Line's host
      clips were regenerated. Four new stations joined dial group 1: KGOL
      Cruisin' Gold 105.9 Oklahoma City (oldies), WGLR Glory Road 91.5
      Birmingham (gospel), KTJO Puro Tejano 107.1 San Antonio (tejano), and
      KNDR Neon Drive 88.5 Las Vegas (synthwave). The sound pack split: the
      music/ subtree, including all the new host clips, station IDs, and
      ads, moved into its own `music.pak`; `sounds.pak` picked up only the
      six new radio imaging beds. Song pools
      are partial by owner decision (ElevenLabs quota exhausted until
      2026-09-06): oldies is a full 8, gospel and tejano have 3 of 8, and
      synthwave has 1 of 8 -- see the follow-up bullets below.
- [x] **Radiostorm curated onto the web band, and one address per station
      -- landed 2026-08-17.** radiostorm.com's four channels (At Work 104,
      Rock 104 Classic Rock, Oldies 104, Comedy 104) are curated entries
      taken from the station's own `.pls` mounts, with the station's own
      names and formats instead of the directory's contributor-typed ones.
      Three of them were on the band twice: Live365 hands the same station
      out under several CDN edge hosts and several bitrate mounts off one
      station id, and `normalize_stream_url` folded none of that.
      It now canonicalizes a Live365 mount onto its station id, so build-time
      collision dropping and the dial's own identity grouping both see them
      as one stream -- 22 duplicate imported rows went with it (Music City
      Roadhouse, KPISS, Deep Space Radio, Retro Album Rock and more, plus a
      row labelled KTHO 590 South Lake Tahoe that was pointed at Boss Boss
      Radio's mount). `canonical_stream_url` then rewrote the 53 rows stored
      at an ephemeral CDN edge host onto `streaming.live365.com`, which is
      what the station publishes and what redirects to a live edge at play
      time; folding the duplicates had otherwise left six stations with only
      their edge-pinned row. Every surviving merged station was checked live
      (14/14 streaming, 200 audio/mpeg); the two mounts that 404 do so on
      every host and are simply off the air.
- [x] **Every stream on the dial checked, and the dead ones taken off --
      landed 2026-08-18.** `tools/check_radio_streams.py` probes all 6,463
      real streams and writes `radio_stream_health.json`;
      `import_radio_catalog.py` drops the imported casualties at build time
      and curated ones are flagged `supported: false` with a dated note, so
      the hand-written research survives a station coming back. 634 imported
      rows dropped, 131 repointed at their Shoutcast `/;` mount, 8 curated
      flagged, 7 curated repaired by hand (KDFC, WMFO, WRBH, WHYR, KFMG,
      WBWC, KEOS). Two false-negative traps are baked into the tool now:
      Python 3.12's default TLS security level refuses the older ciphers
      most Icecast hosts offer and called KBOO, WBAI, KPFK, KZYX and two
      dozen more dead while curl played every one, and a Shoutcast root
      serves an HTML status page rather than audio. Without both fixes the
      sweep reported 820 dead instead of 649.
- [x] **Terrestrial tier widened from the FCC licence record -- landed
      2026-08-18.** `tools/fetch_fcc_transmitters.py` caches all 26,212
      licensed US call signs with real transmitter coordinates, ERP and
      HAAT from the FCC's own FM and AM queries (public domain);
      `import_radio_catalog.py` reads a Radio Browser US snapshot, resolves
      the call sign out of each station's name against that list, and
      places 648 new stations across all 50 states (2,219 resolved; the
      rest collided with a call sign already on the dial or failed the
      reachability sweep). Coverage now comes from
      licensed power in six bands (8 to 55 miles) instead of the flat 40
      every imported row used to get, which had translators reaching three
      counties. The formats added are the ones the Wikidata join missed:
      classic rock, country, classic hits, top 40, oldies. Roughly 500
      commercial stations moved out of the always-available web band to the
      dial position they actually broadcast on. Two gotchas worth keeping:
      the FCC's front end answers 403 to a user agent containing a URL, and
      its query output carries deleted licences under a "D"-prefixed call
      sign that must be filtered or they shadow live stations. Names are
      cleaned of stream jargon *before* the call sign is read out of them:
      "Ambient Sleeping Pill | 128 kbps mp3" was placed at KBPS Portland's
      transmitter on the strength of the bitrate.
- [ ] **The FCC coverage bands are power buckets, not contours.** ERP and
      HAAT are both cached; the real F(50,50) contour uses terrain and
      antenna pattern, and the buckets ignore HAAT entirely. Good enough
      that a translator no longer outreaches a Class C, not good enough to
      call it modelled.
- [ ] **Only stations naming their call sign got placed.** 2,228 of the
      7,750 US directory rows resolved; the rest brand themselves purely
      ("The Fox", "Magic 106.7") and would need a name-and-market match
      against the licence list to place.
- [x] **Reach capped so the dial is not half fringe -- landed 2026-08-18**
      (owner ruling the same day: "sort by the strongest signal so the
      player isn't searching through a bunch of fringe"). The sort was
      already strongest-first in the terrestrial group; the clutter came
      from `RADIO_REACH_MULT` doubling curated ranges of 90-175 miles into
      200-350 mile monsters, against its own note about no station spanning
      three states. `RADIO_MAX_REACH_MI = 150` caps the doubled figure:
      Dallas went 33 terrestrial (15 fringe, furthest 238 mi) to 22 (4
      fringe, furthest 127 mi), and rural dials keep their stations, which
      a 120-mile cap did not. The elevation lift still stacks on top, so
      the ham anchor holds -- a 7000 ft rim reaches 245 miles where the
      flats reach 150; that test's distance moved from 300 to 220 miles and
      its premise did not.
- [ ] **A station skipped by the dial cannot be reached any other way.**
      `station_list_lines` is a read-out, not a picker, so the dial keys are
      the only route to a station. That ruled out the other fix for the
      fringe complaint (seek stepping over weak stations, as a real car
      radio does) and it is worth a picker in its own right.
- [ ] **Re-run the stream sweep before each release.** The health file is a
      snapshot, not a fact: stations come back, and a 5xx on sweep day is a
      bad afternoon rather than a closure. `--recheck-dead` re-probes only
      the casualties, which is cheap enough to be routine.
- [x] **Gospel, tejano, synthwave and the Night Line filled out -- landed
      2026-09-11.** Nineteen songs on Eleven Music `music_v2_5` (gospel +5,
      tejano +5, synthwave +7, Night Line +2), encoded to Opus from the
      kept MP3 masters (`C:\Users\joshu\freight-fate-masters-backup-20260911`).
      The nineteenth call of the run ended the month's credits, so the
      third Night Line ballad (Dashboard Glow) and the top-ups below wait
      for the next reset.
- [ ] **Song top-ups still owed: country, classic rock, blues, jazz (8
      each, planned in `radio_content_pools.py`) and Night Line's Dashboard
      Glow.** `tools/generate_radio.py --plan-songs POOL --limit N` runs
      capped waves; the resume check now recognises the shipped `.opus`
      files, so a re-run never buys a song twice. Three of the country
      top-ups arrived early and by hand -- Dangerous Dan and Dial-up Summer
      on 2026-08-26, Four Sources and the Truth on 2026-08-30, owner
      renders rather than a generated wave.
- [ ] **Voice the second-wave station identity.** Written and wired
      2026-09-11 but not yet generated: twenty more ads
      (`radio_content_ads.py`, 38 in the rotation), two spoken liners per
      station (`radio_content_liners.py`, `id_<station>_05/06`) and a third
      sung jingle per station (`id_<station>_04`). One thing blocks the
      run: the month's credits are spent (the key's missing
      `text_to_speech`, `user_read`, `models_read` and `voices` scopes were
      granted the same night). Budget for the next wave, measured on the
      usage page 2026-09-11: Eleven Music `music_v2_5` bills about 1,600
      credits per minute of audio, not the 900 the pricing page lists for
      v1, so a three-and-a-half-minute song is roughly 5,500 credits and
      the Creator plan's 100,000 covers about eighteen songs a month with
      nothing else running. TTS liners and ads are cheap by comparison
      (one credit per character, about 20,000 for the whole second wave),
      so run `--plan-ids` and `--plan-ads` FIRST after the reset, then
      size the song top-ups with `--limit` from what is left.
      Once the credits are back: `--plan-ids` then `--plan-ads`, measure the clip
      durations, add the rows to `radio_content.rs` `STATION_ID_ROWS` /
      `AD_ROWS` / `AD_FORMAT_ROWS` (and the Python mirror), repack
      `music.pak`. The break planner already draws two spots per stopset,
      so the new rotation takes effect the moment the rows land.
- [x] **Stopsets of two -- landed 2026-09-11.** `BREAK_PATTERN` is now
      host, ID, ad+ad+ID, host, ID, ad+ID: three spots per twelve songs
      where the first batch ran one, still light against real radio. Slot
      kinds are pool names joined by underscores and every pool advances on
      its own draw count, so adding a kind is a one-line change; a pool too
      small for a two-spot set airs one spot rather than the same read
      twice.
- [x] **Every traffic pass and crossing cue is API audio now -- landed
      2026-09-11.** All eleven cues added on 2026-08-20 (pickup, motorcycle,
      bus and tractor passes; car, pickup, box truck, semi, motorcycle, bus
      and tractor crossings) had shipped as the deterministic numpy
      stand-ins, not only the six believed outstanding. Regenerated through
      the Sound Effects API (`eleven_text_to_sound_v2`, named explicitly
      now); the synths stay as `--synth-traffic`. The new `music.pak`
      (378 entries, sha `9b7c9123…`) is built locally and pinned in
      `build_release.py`; it still has to be uploaded to the private
      download host before a release build can fetch it.
- [x] **Generation tooling on current ElevenLabs models -- 2026-09-11.**
      TTS on `eleven_v3` (stability 0.5, no style knob), music on
      `music_v2_5` (`music_v1` is deprecated; there is no music v3),
      sound effects naming `eleven_text_to_sound_v2`. `credit_usage`
      tolerates a key without `user_read` and each response's
      `character-cost` header is printed instead; Music responses carry no
      such header, so a song run's cost is only visible on the dashboard.
- [x] **The in-house stations run their own clock -- landed 2026-08-26
      (Marie, issue #158).** Every tune-in restarted a station's shuffled
      order at track one, second zero, so re-tuning always opened on the same
      song. `radio_rotation::cue_after` replays the station's own rules
      (songs, a break every `RADIO_TRACKS_PER_HOST_BREAK`) forward over a
      drive-wide airtime clock and hands back the cue the playback loop
      resumes from; `initial_airtime_s(trip_seed)` signs the stations on
      before the drive starts, so the first tune-in is mid-song too.
      `Audio::play_music_at` seeks the BASS stream, and a spoken break plays
      whole rather than being cut into. Personal playlists deliberately keep
      starting their entries from the top -- the player's own library is not
      a broadcast.
- [ ] **Song-aware host back-announces.** The rotation now knows exactly
      what a station has just played, so a host break could name it. The
      shipped host segments are generic road chatter, which is what makes
      tuning into the middle of one safe today; a back-announce would have to
      be generated per song and would tie the break pools to the track pools.
- [ ] **Ad music beds.** Light instrumental beds mixed under the ad reads,
      with a ducking pass in the imaging chain; the ad scripts only need a
      cheap re-TTS pass to carry them.
- [ ] **Owner listening pass over the generated station content.** Only
      programmatic QC has run so far; ear-check the hosts, IDs, ads, and
      new songs and regenerate any misfires by key.
- [ ] **Cruise destination-lane selection for drift lane changes.** The
      2026-08-14 fix keeps cruise from braking for the lane you are leaving,
      but only for tap changes under automated lane keeping; a held-wheel
      drift still flips the lead at the line-cross instead of the moment the
      change starts.
- [ ] **Off-air stations should not yank the dial.** Tuning past a dead
      stream should carry on around the dial from where you were instead of
      handing over to a distant fallback station (Darren).
- [x] **Lane names past three lanes -- CAPPED at three (owner ruling,
      2026-08-19: "we don't support five lane highways yet, just three").**
      Left, middle and right cannot tell four or five lanes apart; Sarah hit
      ambiguous callouts on a three-plus road near Riverside. It is a SPEECH
      limit before a driving one, so the answer is not more lane names but
      fewer lanes: `MAX_DRIVABLE_LANES = 3`, applied in `Trip.lane_count_at`,
      the documented single source for "how many lanes the driver has".

      The cap is deliberately NOT in the bakes and NOT in `leg_aadt_at`. HPMS
      records real per-direction counts up to six and those stay true; traffic
      capacity keeps dividing by the real number, because how much road there
      is for traffic and how many lanes a player can occupy are different
      questions. Clamping capacity too would have invented stop-and-go on
      urban freeways that flow -- a six-lane freeway at 250,000 AADT sits
      under a v/c of 1.0 and goes over it if you divide by three. Both halves
      are pinned in `test_multilane_speech.py`.

      Naming four or more lanes remains open as a FEATURE (ordinal names --
      "the second lane from the right"). Until then the cap is what keeps
      every callout unambiguous.
- [x] **theradiostorm.com was on the dial twice; four "Radiostorm" channels
      were really Star104 (owner, 2026-08-19).** The duplicate pair was one
      station under two addresses -- its own `listen.theradiostorm.com:8242`
      and a raw CDN node carrying a cache-busting hash. Both answered live
      with identical `icy-name`, genre and bitrate. Kept the station's own
      host; the CDN node's address will rot.

      NEITHER GENERAL FIX WAS SAFE, which is the part worth keeping:

      - De-dup by NAME slug would have merged 605 of 5,242 imported rows.
        "Rock", "The Rock" and "rock" are different stations sharing a
        generic name; collapsing them deletes real stations.
      - De-dup by STREAM URL would have been worse. 40 urls carry more than
        one dial entry and every one is correct: public radio networks
        (Wyoming Public Radio, Iowa Public Radio, GPB, SDPB, Prairie Public)
        broadcast one network feed from many transmitters, and each entry is
        a real station receivable in its own city -- which is exactly what
        the regional dial exists to model. Collapsing them would have
        deleted Wyoming Public Radio from every city but one.

      So duplicate-hunting on this catalog stays surgical: prove two rows are
      one station in one place before merging them.

      Corrected while there, because these are spoken: the four channels the
      directory filed under "Star 104 / Radiostorm" report
      `icy-url http://star104.net` and name themselves Star104, Country104
      and Christmas104 -- a different operation from radiostorm.com (the four
      curated 104 channels) and from theradiostorm.com. They carry their own
      names now, their raw tag strings ("#80s, 1980s, 1980s hits") became
      single genre words, and five names truncated mid-bracket were repaired.

- [ ] **Game sounds duck under the in-cab radio.** Enforcement markers and
      pass-bys currently talk over the radio instead of alongside it
      (Shane).
- [x] **One-lane roads: a cop cannot pass you, so it should not try**
      (Shane) -- FIXED 2026-09-01. The bubble folds "passing" traffic into
      the truck's own lane where the road has no passing lane, and let it
      drive through the truck; a vehicle behind the truck on a one-lane
      road now holds a following gap at the truck's pace
      (`HOLD_BEHIND_HEADWAY_S`), so nothing goes by and no whoosh plays.
- [ ] **Merging AI yields to a truck** instead of racing it for the gap
      (Shane, long-standing).
- [ ] **Should the engine start off at trip start?** Design question from
      Darren -- starting it yourself is already how the first-run
      walkthrough begins, so there is a real choice to make.
- [x] **Ramps onto another freeway no longer roll for a control
      (2026-08-18).** The half of the owner's request that was a fact rather
      than a preference. Measured: all 18,011 baked exits carry an empty
      `ramp_control`, so the seeded heuristic decides every terminal in the
      game, and 4,999 of those exits (27.8 percent) lead to an interstate.
      Every one was taking its chances with weights that hand stop signs to
      half the rural ones -- roughly 2,500 stop signs and 1,500 traffic
      lights placed where two freeways meet, which cannot happen. Now read
      off the interchange's own baked `via` (`FREEWAY_VIA_RE`,
      `Trip.interchange_at`) and decided before the dice.

      A literal 0x08 byte got written into `FREEWAY_VIA_RE` on the way in,
      from shell escaping, three times across source and test. It compiled,
      matched every interstate correctly, and silently matched "HAWAII 1" as
      well -- invisible in an editor and in a diff. A test pins the word
      boundary and builds its backslash with `chr(92)` so the check cannot
      fall into the hole it exists to catch.

- [ ] **Testers report sounds are quieter at the quiet speech rung, and
      three measured suspects all went the OTHER way (Shane P, 2026-08-18).**
      He flagged it honestly as "think, not know", then narrowed it to
      troopers. Still unexplained, and worth other ears before more guessing.

      ELIMINATED, so do not re-check these:
      1. The confirmation earcon swap (hazard-clear chime -> its own note).
         Catalog volume fell 0.75 -> 0.32, which looks damning, but MEASURED
         it is -27.5 dBFS RMS before against -23.6 after: **3.9 dB LOUDER**.
         The synthesized note is dense where the ogg chime is sparse.
      2. The trooper pass level, after `enforcement_presence` was removed and
         the scale became road post density. Measured across a real route the
         density runs 1.0 to 1.3, so the pass plays between exactly the old
         flat level and **2.3 dB louder**. It never goes below.
      3. Extra mix ducking at quiet, on the theory that far more earcons fire
         there. It does not: the duck is gated on `duck_audio_for_speech`,
         which is OFF by default, and `_play_ladder_earcon` calls
         `audio.play` directly without touching it.

      THE LESSON THAT KEEPS REPEATING: a catalog volume is a MULTIPLIER, not
      a loudness. Twice this week a suspect looked obvious from the number
      and measured the opposite way (the other was Darren's road lean).
      Measure the rendered RMS, never compare multipliers.

      WHAT WOULD ACTUALLY SPLIT IT, asked of Shane and pending: does a
      trooper sound low in EVERY speech mode, or only quiet? Every mode means
      the sound itself and the speech setting is a red herring. Only quiet
      means something in the speech layer collides with it -- and since level
      and ducking are ruled out, that would point at masking or timing: a cue
      now landing under an earcon it never used to collide with.

- [ ] **No way to route around an active work zone (Brandon, 2026-08-18).**
      "Truckers don't always go through construction work zones when they are
      active; when possible they will detour onto different roads to avoid
      the risks and delays." A fair observation about how the job really
      works, and the game currently gives no choice: the route runs through
      whatever construction the corridor carries.

      The natural home is ROUTE PLANNING, not the wheel. A driver decides
      this before rolling, off the work-zone data we already bake (the WZDx
      feeds behind the construction zones), not by improvising at 60 mph. So
      the shape is an alternate route offered when the planned one crosses an
      active zone, with the trade spoken plainly -- extra miles and time
      against the delay and the risk -- rather than a mid-drive detour.

      Not started, and it is a feature rather than a fix. Wants an owner call
      on scope: it touches dispatch, route choice, and the spoken comparison
      of two routes, which is a bigger piece than it sounds.

- [x] **URGENT, MINE, SHIPPED: the ladder silenced changed content at
      STANDARD (Darren, 2026-08-19). FIXED 2026-08-19.** Reported as
      "certain messages I can read with comma and period are not being
      spoken... the dings play but no messages... very sporadic". From their
      own log, and they are on **standard**, the default rung:

        [ladder] standard already said: 75 miles per hour
        [ladder] standard already said: 69 miles per hour
        [ladder] standard already said: 66 miles per hour
        [ladder] standard already said: 57 miles per hour
        [ladder] standard already said: Clear of the car. Right lane open.

      310 dropped lines in one leg of `game.prev.log`, "62 miles per hour"
      twelve times among them. This is my change from 2026-08-18
      (`feat(speech): standard stops repeating itself`), and it silenced
      real information at the DEFAULT rung.

      I HAD NAMED THE WRONG BRANCH. It was not FIRST_OCCURRENCE. At
      standard, FIRST_OCCURRENCE covers only COACHING, and the one line in
      the game carrying that category is keyless and edge-gated, so it
      behaved correctly. Every dropped line above is **STATUS**, which
      standard delivers on TRANSITIONS -- and TRANSITIONS' fallback for a
      line with no key was `slot = key or text`, using the text as its own
      condition. That turns "enter, worsen, and clear" into "this exact
      sentence once per leg, ever", which is why the damage grew with leg
      length and read as sporadic. Checking the CATEGORY of each line in the
      log is what found it; the roadmap's own guess would have left the bug
      in place.

      THE FIX (`_ladder_repeats`): a keyless line is a discrete moment, not
      a standing condition -- its call site has already decided this
      occurrence is worth saying -- so TRANSITIONS no longer suppresses it
      at all. The pacer's 2.5-second repeat window still stops the same line
      landing twice in a breath, which was the only repetition worth
      blunting. FIRST_OCCURRENCE now keys on `(key, text)` rather than the
      key alone, so a keyed readout whose number moves cannot be swallowed
      the same way; that was latent rather than reported, and is fixed in
      the same change.

      Three tests in `test_driving_speech_ladder.py`, driven from the log's
      own lines.

- [x] **A stale flush stops destroying the line it lands on before that
      line has said anything -- 2026-08-23.** `[pacer] stale event backlog
      flushed` appears 57 times in the owner's 23 August session against 221
      event-channel submissions -- about one flush in four. Replaying the
      log's own timeline through the pacer's projection arithmetic says what
      the flushes cost: **59 lines were purged before they finished, and 34
      of those were cut inside `BASE_UTTERANCE_S` of their own start**, so by
      the pacer's own duration model the voice had not uttered a character of
      them. By kind the losses are the drive itself -- 26 turn-by-turn
      navigation lines, 13 exit/destination lines, 9 traffic-light
      instructions, 4 arrivals, 1 hazard call.

      The mechanism: `should_flush` judged staleness from the INCOMING line
      only, and rescued the outgoing one only when it was CRITICAL. A ROUTE
      line 20 ms into its delivery is not an aged backlog -- it is the same
      instant of road as the line cutting it -- but it was dropped with the
      backlog and no requeue. Three route lines inside 37 ms took the
      ramp-exit briefing with them ("Off the ramp and onto city streets:
      start on unnamed public road. Then turn right now onto Halleck
      Street"), and the turn was never spoken.

      THE FIX (`speech_pacing.should_flush`): the rescue now asks how much
      of the outgoing line the player actually got. Inside the pre-utterance
      window it is handed back and queued behind the line that cut it,
      exactly as a CRITICAL cut has always been; past it the line has said
      something and its tail is still expendable, so an aged route backlog is
      still discarded rather than recited. `RESCUE_ONCE_WINDOW_S` still caps
      it at one hand-back per line. Three tests in
      `test_event_speech_pacer.py`; the end-to-end dock-approach test was
      counting submissions and had been pinning a real loss -- the yard
      speed and the docking instruction were both destroyed before a word of
      either was said -- and now pins the hand-backs instead. Found and
      fixed first in the Rust port (`speech_pacing.rs`), which was
      line-for-line identical here, so this was an inherited behaviour
      rather than a port divergence.

      AND ONE THING THE WIDER RESCUE EXPOSED, caught by the adversarial
      battery rather than by the suite: `scale_bypass_to_the_end` began
      hearing "Signal for the scale exit" three times, because the open-scale
      notice ("Open weigh station ahead in 4.0 miles: ...") was now rescuable
      and carried no `valid` callback, so it could be handed back AFTER the
      half-mile reminder and tell the driver the scale was four miles off.
      The half-mile reminder already had a guard; the notice did not, and it
      goes wrong EARLIER than the reminder does -- while the scale is still
      ahead, not once it is behind. Its guard is derived from the line's own
      words rather than a chosen tolerance: the notice stays valid only while
      the road left still speaks as the phrase it already spoke
      (`short_distance_text`), which is exactly the span over which replaying
      it says nothing untrue. Any other distance-bearing ROUTE line that can
      be rescued wants the same treatment; `_scale_outranks_rest_planning`
      still has none.

- [ ] **The ramp-exit chain and the route's own first navigation cue say the
      same street 20 ms apart.** The arrival/departure chain builds "Off the
      ramp and onto city streets: start on <street>. Then <first corner>.
      <distance> to the facility gate." from the first leg's local cue; the
      navigation cue builder then speaks that same local cue on its own --
      "Start on unnamed public road." -- one or two frames later. The pacer
      cannot dedupe them because one text merely CONTAINS the other, so both
      go to the voice and the second flushes the first. In the owner's
      23 August log this pair fires on every ramp exit and every gate
      departure, four times each way. One of the two should stand down when
      the other has already named the street.

- [x] **Realistic pacing retired; the row is Relaxed and Standard (owner,
      2026-08-19).** Realistic was 40x game-clock compression -- the FASTEST
      of the three, and therefore the least like real driving, which is 1x.
      It also carried standard's pressure tuning field for field
      (`driving_modes._MODES`), so it was never a difficulty at all: only a
      clock multiplier wearing a difficulty's name. Retiring it costs no
      tuning.

      A save carrying 40.0 migrates to 20.0 in `Settings.load` and arms
      `pace_retired_notice_left`, because the migration halves the rate their
      game clock bills and nothing else would say so -- they would meet it as
      an hours-of-service day that suddenly lasts twice as long. Only the
      exact retired value migrates; a hand-edited custom scale still runs at
      whatever it says, as it always has. 40x is still reachable in play and
      still exercised by tests: `PARKED_TIME_SCALE_MULT` doubles standard
      while parked.

      Found on the way: `SettingsCategoryState.announce_entry` speaks the
      landing row through `ctx.say` rather than `speak_current`, so a
      row-specific notice hung on `speak_current` alone could never reach a
      player whose row is the one they land on -- which is every player for
      Driving mode, the first row of its category. The lane-keeping rename
      notice had the same hole, hidden only because Lane keeping is not first
      in its category. Both now fire from `announce_entry` too.

- [x] **Ambient speech rides a queue; four strict xfails closed
      (2026-08-19).** An ambient line -- a billboard, a lane count, a mapped
      state line -- waited in a SINGLE slot. Any later ambient line
      overwrote it and any hazard discarded it outright, so a surveyed state
      crossing never reached the driver and `_check_cities` compensated with
      a duplicate "Crossing into Ohio." prefix on the next city line.

      Now a bounded FIFO (`AMBIENT_QUEUE_MAX`) with an age cap
      (`AMBIENT_QUEUE_MAX_AGE_S`): lines keep their place, a hazard costs
      nothing, and a line that waits out a long hazard expires rather than
      being performed late. It also finishes Sarah's 2026-08-14 report
      properly -- her lane closure that "dinged and vanished" was only kept
      in review before, and is now actually heard once the road clears.

      TWO THINGS THE QUEUE ALONE GOT WRONG, both caught by tests:

      A countdown must SUPERSEDE, not stack. "CB chatter in 5 miles" then
      "in 4" queued both, so the driver heard five while sitting at four --
      wrong, where the old overwrite was merely lossy. `_ambient_key` gives
      the lines that count down toward a standing thing (patrol post,
      traffic pressure, toll, weather) a key, and a keyed line replaces the
      one already waiting in place. Moments stay unkeyed and still queue.

      THE HARNESS WAS LYING, and this is the one worth remembering:
      `tests/playtest_harness.py::_drive_one_frame` hand-rolls a frame and
      never called `_update_ambient_events`, which only the real
      `DrivingUpdateMixin.update` does. Instrumented over a full
      Indianapolis->Atlanta delivery: **42 ambient lines queued, zero
      spoken.** The channel jams on the first line and stays jammed for the
      whole drive, because the spacing cooldown it sets is decremented
      nowhere else. So the xfail's stated cause ("on an interstate the
      checkpoint cues fire constantly, so it never gets out") was describing
      the harness, not the game, and every harness test has been
      under-reporting spoken ambient output. The frame drains it now. When a
      harness finding blames the game, check the harness runs the same frame
      the game does before believing it.

- [x] **Ticketed for a gap the assist was managing (Darren, 2026-08-18) --
      FIXED 2026-08-19.** 1,200 dollars for "following too close" at a work
      zone on I-75, with adaptive cruise driving. ACC targets
      `ACC_BASE_GAP_SECONDS` (3.0), and `TAILGATE_GAP_S` is 1.2, so the
      steady state was never the problem -- the taper bunched the line up
      faster than ACC's comfort deceleration could give ground, and the gap
      dipped through the band while the assist recovered it.

      THE ASYMMETRY, sitting in plain sight in `enforcement_observe`:
      speeding required `over_limit_mi >= OBSERVE_HOLD_MI` ("a speed rather
      than a blip", its own comment); following-too-close required nothing at
      all, so one sampled frame was the offence. It now needs the same held
      stretch of road, and `_accrue_following_gap` refuses to accrue while an
      automatic speed control is braking -- the identical carve-out the
      over-limit accumulator already had, and whose own comment says it
      exists so the game does not ticket "the most cautious drivers in the
      game for using the feature".

      No test covered following-too-close at all before this, which is how it
      shipped. Three now do, driven from his log's sequence.

- [x] **An assist changed the truck's speed and the reason was dropped
      (Darren, 2026-08-18) -- FIXED 2026-08-19.** From his log, seventeen
      seconds before the trooper stopped him:

        [pacer] stale ambient dropped: Construction zone ahead;
                adaptive cruise easing to 45 miles per hour.

      The line rode AMBIENT (the default for `interrupt=False`), so
      `would_start_stale` was free to bin it. A line reporting that an assist
      is taking or handing back control of the truck is a consequence, not
      colour -- the same call already made for the toll charge -- so all four
      now ride `EventPriority.ROUTE`'s never-dropped contract.

- [x] **The archived line is on the road it names (2026-08-25).** Every layer
      that asks "what road is this" -- interchanges, lanes, postings, tolls,
      curves -- reads the archived polyline, so a line that strays reads a
      road the truck never drives. `tools/offroad.py` measures the real
      thing: it samples inside every gap longer than two miles and asks the
      router how far the nearest truck-drivable road actually is. 250 legs
      sat outside the 90 m match corridor, worst 2,699 m.

      BEWARE the metric that came before it, which counted a long straight
      SEGMENT as damage and made 985 legs look broken. On a dead-straight
      interstate two vertices thirty miles apart describe the road perfectly;
      Douglas-Peucker is right to keep only those. Damage is the line lying
      where no road is, and nothing else.

      `tools/repair_geometry.py` re-fetches shape and elevation and re-runs
      the corrected simplifier -- no Overpass, so it does not inherit that
      service's refusals. It adopted 210 and refused 40, on two screens it
      will not be talked out of: the new shape's length must still agree with
      the miles the leg is PAID on (beyond 6 percent the router has chosen a
      different road), and it must actually beat the old line's worst
      distance.

      NOT PLAYER-FACING ON ITS OWN, and this was nearly mis-shipped as a
      changelog entry: nothing under `src/` reads `world_data/us/geometry/`.
      Only the build tools do, through `leg_geometry.py`. Repairing the
      archive changes what the NEXT bake produces and nothing a driver hears
      until that bake runs.

- [ ] **Re-bake the derived layers over the 210 repaired legs.** Curves,
      speed postings and ramps for those legs were derived from the line that
      has just been replaced, so they describe road the truck no longer
      drives -- and they UNDER-report, because where the old line cut a
      corner across open country it had no bends on it at all to find. The
      four canyon controls are unmoved (Glenwood 70/20, Vail Pass 59/3, Salt
      River 143/77, US-550 276/180), which says the repair broke nothing; it
      does not say the repaired legs are now right.

      Blocked on Overpass, not on the work: `bake_curve_geometry` asks it for
      shields, postings and ramps, and it refused every corridor query on the
      long legs -- HTTP 500 on Billings to Salt Lake, and again on Charleston
      to Pittsburgh, which is what killed the 24-leg run. The fix is to stop
      asking it, and there are two answers, not one.

      MOST OF IT IS ALREADY ANSWERED by the local router's own
      `/trace_attributes`, which was checked against the running instance
      rather than assumed. Valhalla does not store OSM; it compiles the PBF
      once into its own graph and keeps a fixed schema per edge. What that
      schema keeps is very nearly the bake's shopping list -- measured on
      I-70 west of Denver:

        names ['I 70']  road_class motorway  speed_limit  lane_count
        toll  truck_route  use (road / ramp)  surface  bridge  tunnel
        weighted_grade  way_id

      Shields survive because Valhalla folds the OSM `ref` into `names`, and
      ramps are labelled outright by `use`. Map matching also puts every one
      of those on the leg's OWN line, which a bounding-box Overpass query
      never did.

      WHAT IT CANNOT ANSWER is anything outside that schema, because the tags
      are gone: `maxheight`, `maxweight`, `hgv`, `destination` signs, POI
      tags, any arbitrary key. Access limits survive only pre-digested, as
      the `access_restrictions` on `/locate`. For those, go to the PBF --
      `us-latest.osm.pbf` is already on the box, `tools/toll_ways.py` shows
      the shape (a C++-side tag filter read the whole country in 124
      seconds), and every edge carries `way_id` so a Valhalla answer can be
      joined straight back to the OSM way it came from.

      CAVEAT on grades: this tileset was built with `build_elevation=False`,
      so `weighted_grade` is flat and `max_upward_grade` comes back as the
      -500 sentinel. Grades still come from the elevation service, which is
      why `FF_VALHALLA_ELEVATION_URL` is a separate endpoint.

- [ ] **Finish the geometry repair: 250 legs' curves still describe the old
      line.** `repair_geometry.py` writes the geometry shards and nothing
      else, so the legs it put back on their road still carry curves derived
      from the line that was OFF it. Those curves were already wrong -- they
      were read off a line up to 2.7 km from the road -- so this is an
      unfinished repair rather than a new fault, but it is unfinished. It
      shows up as `curve_valhalla_facts --all` reporting 205 legs skipped
      where it used to skip none: the rows no longer re-detect against the
      geometry they are supposed to describe.

      THE OBVIOUS FIX IS THE SLOW ONE. `bake_curve_geometry --from-archive`
      re-derives them correctly, but it also asks Overpass for speed limits
      per leg, and that took twelve minutes for ONE leg before it was killed
      -- fifty hours for the 250. Overpass is the whole cost here and none of
      it is spent on curves: `analyse_curvature` reads the geometry alone.

      So the work is a curves-only mode that skips `query_leg_ways`,
      `bake_speed_limits` and `harvest_ramps` and rewrites only the curve
      rows. Then re-run `curve_valhalla_facts --all --local` and check the
      four controls with `tools/curve_noise.py`. EXPECT THE CONTROLS TO MOVE:
      Salt River Canyon is one of the 250, and its old 143 curves were read
      off a line 834 m from the road, so a change there is the repair
      working. Judge the new number against the road, not against the old one.

- [x] **Unnamed local roads are named by what they are.** 1,195 of the 12,820
      turn-level segments said "unnamed public road", heard at every turn onto
      one, on 12 percent of arrivals.

      THE NAMES ARE NOT RECOVERABLE and it is worth writing down why, so
      nobody spends a week on it. Measured over the whole us-latest extract:
      of 24,671,936 drivable local ways with no `name`, 22,951,151 are
      `highway=service` -- driveways, delivery lanes, parking aisles -- and
      only 162,733 carry a recoverable TIGER name, 82,354 of those outside
      the service classes. That is 0.33 percent, or about EIGHT of the 1,195.
      Valhalla cannot help at all: it compiles OSM into a fixed per-edge
      schema and the tags a name might hide in are not in it.

      What shipped instead is the road's CLASS, which OSM does know: "a
      service road" for the service ways, "a side street" for unnamed
      residential and minor streets. Owner picked the wording; both are rows
      in `docs/ontology.md`.

      ONE TRAP, RECORDED BECAUSE IT IS INVISIBLE: the 15 mph local zone was
      chosen by comparing the road name against the literal "unnamed public
      road". A second generic label would have read as a real name and moved
      1,179 segments to 25 mph without a single test failing. Both builders
      now ask `is_named()`, which tests membership of the generic set --
      including the retired wording, so data baked before this does not
      change speed on load.

      WHAT THAT CHANGE DID NOT REACH (agent drive, 2026-09-01): only
      `local_geometry.json` was re-baked. `facility_approaches.json` -- the
      file every dock's street chain actually comes from -- was never re-run
      and still carries the literal "unnamed public road" as a road name on
      3,230 of its segments (989 of 5,037 records), with the cue sentence
      baked around it; `local_approaches.json` has one such record. Heard as
      "start on unnamed public road" out of Chicago Cross-Dock. The runtime
      now reads the retired label as "a side street" wherever a stale bake
      still carries it (`spoken_road_text`), on the arrival chain and the
      reversed departure chain alike, so the truck never says it again
      whatever the data holds.

- [ ] **Re-run the facility approach bake so nameless lanes get their real
      class.** The runtime stand-in above says "a side street" for every
      stale record because the segments carry no highway class, and the
      national measurement says about nine in ten of those lanes are really
      service ways. `tools/build_facility_approaches.py --write` over the
      49-state batch (and `tools/build_local_approaches.py` for the one
      record there) with the same extracts, then the world container
      re-bake. Until then the wording is honest but class-blind on facility
      approaches; the builder's side of the promise is pinned by
      `tests/test_facility_approaches.py::test_build_tool_says_what_an_unnamed_road_is`.

- [ ] **Elevation: give the build box its own, and do not mix sources.**
      Two separate things, and they were briefly confused for each other.

      NOTHING WAS LOST. The 145,752 grade segments in `world_data` came from
      OpenRouteService elevation profiles, not from Valhalla, and are intact
      across all 1,291 legs. Per-vertex elevation is in the geometry archive
      and is real on the repaired legs -- Soldier Summit reads 7,490 ft
      against a true 7,477.

      WHAT IS MISSING is only that the local tileset cannot answer `/height`,
      because it was built with `build_elevation=False`, so bakes borrow the
      public instance -- the same external dependency that Overpass turned
      out to be. `valhalla.json` already points at `/custom_files/
      elevation_data` and the directory is empty. Populating it is enough;
      `/height` reads that directory, NOT the routing graph, so this does not
      mean repeating the five-hour tile build.

      DO NOT RE-BAKE GRADES LEG BY LEG. Measured ORS against Valhalla at the
      spacing grades are actually built at (`ELEVATION_STEP_MI` = 0.1), over
      902 runs on five mountain legs the repair never touched:

        grade disagreement   median 1.29%   p90 6.49%   p99 14.42%

      One tenth-mile run in ten differs by more than a full mountain grade.
      Re-surveying some legs on one terrain model and leaving the rest on
      another puts both in the same world, and a driver feels it as a hill
      that exists on one route and not on the equivalent road next door. If
      the source ever changes it changes for all 1,291 legs at once, as a
      deliberate re-survey.

      Beware measuring this the quick way: comparing slopes over runs SHORTER
      than the bake spacing turns a constant offset between the two models
      into a fake grade. A first attempt reported a 6 percent p90 that was
      mostly its own sampling noise.

- [ ] **33 legs whose road a truck router will not take.** The refusals
      above, minus 7 that were already within a few metres of the corridor.
      On these the loaded-semi profile wants a route 6 to 84 percent longer
      or shorter than the leg's curated mileage -- Hazard to London KY
      +84 percent, Evansville to Clarksville +57, Payson to Winslow -41.
      Either the mileage is wrong, or the road the leg is on is one an
      80,000 lb rig should not be routed down. Both matter and they are not
      the same fix; deciding needs the owner, because mileage drives pay and
      deadlines. Re-check with `tools/repair_geometry.py --only <leg>`, which
      prints the router's length against the curated one and refuses rather
      than adopting.

- [ ] **Tolls: the reading is fixed, the pricing is half done.**
      `tools/toll_evidence.py` matches each leg's line against the tolled
      ways extracted from the PBF and groups hits into runs an authority's
      schedule can actually answer. Two classes of sighting were being
      counted that a tractor-trailer can never be charged for, and are now
      excluded: managed, HOT and express lanes, which ban trucks and carry
      the free mainline's own route number; and tolled RAMPS, which run
      beside the free mainline at every interchange -- 21,203 of them carry
      no name, operator, ref or network at all, which is where "unnamed
      tolled road" came from as the third most-sighted facility in the
      country.

      `tools/toll_price.py` joins that evidence to the curated rates and
      REFUSES to price a crossing nobody has read a schedule for, rather than
      filling it with a plausible number -- which is the exact defect the 46
      "estimated" toll events were rebuilt to remove. 38 city-pair rates are
      researched and can be applied; the rest is a research queue the tool
      prints, biggest road first.

      CORRECTION to a claim that was in CLAUDE.md: `ramp_control` is NOT
      empty on all 18,011 interchanges. 8,205 carry a real OSM value since
      the exit-control bake; 9,806 still fall to the seeded runtime fallback.

      SPEED POSTINGS, since they drive both what is spoken and what the
      player is fined against: the bake is honest (a gap is a null, never an
      invented number), but the RUNTIME fill is silent. A null resolves
      through `corridor_speed_limit(class, region)`, and 12,701 of the
      world's 139,458 miles -- 9.1 percent -- get their limit that way,
      indistinguishable to the player and to enforcement. Worth surfacing or
      narrowing; not yet done.

      LANDMARKS remain the layer with no provenance at all, which is why a
      tester who knows an area is the only source we have for them (see
      Brandon's demolished planetarium).

- [x] **Career 1.9 congestion preserves local conditions.** Keep each sampled
      volume paired with its own lane count and road limit. Coalesce only
      contiguous matching samples; preserve clear gaps instead of extending
      the worse restriction across them. Rust regressions cover local speed
      variation and a clear stretch between two busy sections. Adjacent active
      sections with equal speeds share their spoken warning; actual changes
      in pace still receive advance and entry announcements.

- [x] **FHWA HPMS AADT baked onto the world -- SHIPPED 2026-08-19.** 1,284 of
      1,290 legs, 10,686 volume samples. Congestion had been falling back to a
      class/metro heuristic that "rarely jams on its own": a sweep of 12 seeds
      across 8 metro pairs found not one congestion zone, so in practice the
      game had no traffic jams at any hour. Real volumes put them where they
      belong -- I-5 through LA at 292,500 AADT goes over capacity at peak, and
      US-385 in Nebraska never does.

      PROVENANCE: every sample says "derived" and names the derivation -- a
      median of the HPMS sections snapping within 250 m of a five-mile window,
      rounded to the nearest 500. Nothing is invented: a window with too few
      real sections produces no sample, and a leg with no coverage keeps the
      heuristic rather than getting a made-up profile.

      A LOAD SCREEN repairs lane counts that contradict their own volume: two
      records on CA-99 claimed ONE lane per direction while carrying 69,000
      and 43,500 vehicles a day, which is a divided freeway and a country lane
      described in the same breath. Left alone, congestion would have divided
      that volume by a single lane and parked a permanent phantom jam on a
      road that flows.

      NPC spawn density (`_leg_density`) now reads the same AADT chain
      congestion does -- vehicles per mile from this hour's share of the
      day's volume, Poisson per spawn cell -- so a quiet rural highway is
      measurably sparser than a busy freeway at the hour it is quieter. The
      ORDER is real; the absolute COUNT still is not, because the bubble
      caps at `MAX_BUBBLE_VEHICLES` (~5/mile) while a median road at peak
      wants thirteen in your direction. Lifting that cap is 1.10 work with a
      performance question attached.

- [ ] **Congestion queue re-pacing when the clock moves the zone.** The
      braking lead in an injected jam now paces the zone's live prevailing
      speed (Brandon's held-at-25-in-a-45-zone fix, 2026-08-20), but the
      following/cruising queue vehicles keep the speed they were seeded with
      for the life of the zone -- so a jam that eases from the 26 band to the
      45 band as rush hour ends keeps its old slower metal until the truck
      passes it. They never take an exit either, by design; re-pacing them
      from the zone's refreshed number would let a clearing jam audibly speed
      up around the player.

- [x] **FHWA HPMS Terrain_Type baked per leg -- SHIPPED 2026-08-19.** 1,273 of
      1,290 legs. Exists because the world's own `terrain` field is derived
      from NET elevation change end to end and is wrong often enough to
      matter: checked against HPMS it agreed on only **851 of 1,273 legs
      (67 percent)**. I-70 through Glenwood Canyon is tagged "flat"; the
      single worst grade record in the game, +14.4 percent on I-5, sits on a
      leg tagged "mountain" while HPMS calls that ground level.

      TWO PROXIES WERE TRIED AND BOTH FAILED BEFORE THIS, which is the part
      worth remembering:

      1. The `terrain` label itself. Screening on it took 21 real curves off
         Glenwood Canyon.
      2. Feet of elevation range per mile, a number I invented and tuned by
         eye against five probe legs. Calibrated properly against HPMS over a
         92-leg sample it measured WEAK -- Youden's J of 0.29 -- and at the
         threshold it suggested it mislabelled 54 percent of rolling and
         mountainous legs. Shipping it would have been a guess wearing a
         number, which is exactly what CLAUDE.md's provenance rule forbids,
         and it took an owner challenge ("verify all this stuff with data") to
         catch. THE LESSON: calibrate a threshold against real data and report
         how well it separates, or do not have a threshold.

      PROVENANCE: `type` is READ -- HPMS asserts the class. What is DERIVED is
      that one value stands for a whole leg (the modal class over the sections
      the leg touches), and the source string says so. Absence stays absence:
      a leg HPMS never classified is never read as level, because the screens
      treat level ground as licence to remove geometry.

- [x] **Curve audit: the map bent far more than the road does -- SHIPPED
      2026-08-19.** Owner: "cruising down the highway or turnpike in a car, it
      hardly ever curves. I want an honest audit."

      MEASURED: 63,873 curve records, 55,434 mainline. The median interstate
      curve radius was 1,342 ft; the tenth percentile across all mainline was
      281 ft, which is an intersection rather than a highway. Interstate curve
      callouts ran 5.7 per 100 miles. Separately, 46 percent of mainline
      curves are INERT -- advisory 80 to 115 mph, and every consumer gates on
      `speed > advisory + margin`, so a truck can never trigger them. Dead
      weight in a 12.5 MB file, not noise; left alone deliberately.

      THE FLOOR IS COMPUTED, NOT REMEMBERED. `min_radius_ft` evaluates the
      AASHTO point-mass control from FHWA-HRT-17-098 with Green Book table 3-7
      friction factors, and a test checks the output against TxDOT Roadway
      Design Manual tables 4-6 and 4-7. My first pass hand-typed 1,330 ft as
      the interstate floor -- that is the SIXTY mph minimum; 70 mph needs
      1,815 at 8 percent superelevation -- so the screen was letting a whole
      design-speed step of bad geometry through. Design speed now comes from
      each leg's own baked OSM maxspeed rather than a guess at its class.

      TERRAIN COMES FROM HPMS, not the world's label and not a relief
      heuristic; see the terrain bake entry above for why both failed.

      RESULT: interstate curve callouts 5.7 -> 2.4 per 100 miles, US highway
      14.7 -> 7.4, state/local 18.6 -> 9.9. Glenwood Canyon keeps all 60 of
      its curves. On I-77 Akron->Cleveland the screen removed two 82 ft
      records turning 119 and 162 degrees -- on an interstate.

- [x] **Grade screen now reads the real terrain class (2026-08-19).** The
      screen itself already existed and is sound -- it CLAMPS rather than
      drops, because grades tile the leg continuously and dropping a spike
      would swap a noisy measurement for an invented terrain average. Its
      class ceilings match what an independent check found (FHWA allows 6
      percent in mountainous terrain, 7 by exception, and I-70 west of Denver
      really holds 7). What changed is which terrain it asks: HPMS leads, the
      segment's own label is the fallback, and a leg HPMS never classified
      screens exactly as before. 926 -> 1,157 segments clamped; still zero
      interstate segments above 7 percent.

      NOTE: CLAUDE.md claimed "grade still has none". It had one. That claim
      and the stale ramp_control one are why the provenance status moved out
      of that file and into this one.

- [ ] **Traffic density reads real AADT; the BUBBLE is now the limiter
      (2026-08-19).** Spawn density used to be a class/metro heuristic --
      "does this leg have checkpoints" standing in for how busy the road is.
      It reads the baked HPMS volume under the truck now, through the chain
      congestion already uses, and turns the expected count in a spawn cell
      into an occupancy chance the honest way (arrivals are Poisson, so
      P(at least one) is 1 - exp(-lambda)).

      WHAT IT CANNOT DO, measured rather than guessed: a spawn cell is 0.4 mi
      and density is a PROBABILITY, so it saturates at 1. The median road at
      5 pm wants 5.3 vehicles per cell and a 10th-percentile rural road wants
      1.3; the whole bubble holds about 5 vehicles per mile against a median
      demand of 13 in your direction alone. So anything above roughly 45,000
      AADT pins at the ceiling through the day, and the differentiation that
      survives is at the quiet end and overnight -- which is real, and is
      what a player notices most.

      THE REMAINING WORK is the bubble, not the model: several vehicles per
      cell and a much larger MAX_BUBBLE_VEHICLES than 28, which carries a
      performance question and wants a playtest pass. Deliberately not tuned
      to "feel right" in the meantime -- the Poisson number is the physically
      correct occupancy and the representation is what is short.

- [x] **The playtest harness kept losing its simulated clock (2026-08-24).**
      `put_road_events_on_simulated_time` wired the road-event breather onto
      the harness's fake clock at `start_delivery` and `start_route`, and the
      very next `with_drive` that laid a bench road or a street chain tore the
      wiring straight back out: a fresh `Trip` carries a fresh breather, and a
      fresh breather runs on the wall clock. With a 10-to-15 REAL second hold
      over minutes of simulated road, how many lines survived came down to how
      loaded the machine was -- the exit-call audit in
      `transcript_spoken_truth` was dropping a call about one full-suite run
      in five. The wiring now lives in `with_drive` itself, so a trip swap
      cannot outlive it.

- [x] **The speed keeper holds the posted number on a grade, and owns up
      when it cannot (2026-08-24).** Owner: "sometimes it doesn't hold the
      posted speeds." Measured on a zone bench at four posted numbers across
      nine grades, loaded, with the weather pinned: the keeper held its
      number on the flat and then sagged the moment the road tilted -- 55
      held 49.4 on one percent and 33.9 on two, 45 held 37.5 on two percent
      and 27.4 on three, and every number was in the teens on six. The cause
      was `KEEPER_MAX_THROTTLE`, a half-pedal ceiling whose stated premise
      ("zone speeds never need more than half throttle") is a claim about
      FLAT road: the keeper was a bare integrator against it, so on a hill it
      wound to the clamp and settled wherever half throttle balanced gravity.
      Silently -- the keeper warned about running OVER its number and had
      nothing at all to say about running under it. It now feed-forwards on
      `hold_throttle()` exactly as adaptive cruise does, with the half-pedal
      limit kept as the ceiling on its own TRIM over the road's demand, and
      says "Speed keeper is flat out and cannot make X on this grade" once a
      hill genuinely beats the truck. Every measured sag now holds its
      number; a 65 mph merge that asymptoted at 58 and never arrived now
      does, and a 45 recovers in 28 s against 41. Pinned in
      `states_driving_speed_keeper_sweep.rs`, which also carries the
      measurement rigs (`--ignored`) and pins the two by-design answers to
      the owner's second sentence: the keeper eases for a corner only where
      the corner's advisory is under the number it holds, and adaptive
      cruise caps for a bend only where the bend's advisory is under the
      posted limit. NOT DONE: the keeper is deaf to `trip.curves`. It reads
      street turn cues and posted limits only, so inside a work-zone or
      heavy-traffic zone that contains a baked bend advising below the zone
      limit, nothing eases for it -- 0 cases in the 20-corridor sweep,
      because every bend met there advised at or above posted, but the gap
      is real and belongs with the 2.0 assist work.

      MEASURED, 2026-08-24 (`states_driving_traffic_rate.rs`, 5 200 seeded
      route miles over twenty real corridors): the bubble holds 0.37 vehicles
      per mile of road in the direction of travel against the 2.65 its own
      volume model asks for at the same miles -- a seventh, not a fifth as the
      saturation argument above estimated. The binding constraint is not
      MAX_BUBBLE_VEHICLES (the mean population is two) but that
      `spawned_cells` gives each cell of road exactly one draw ever, so the
      window is only ever fed from its leading edge, and `exit_at_mi` retires
      each vehicle after 2.5 to 11 miles of its own travel. Re-arming cells
      behind the truck is the change that would close it, and it is a real
      decision: it multiplies the population several-fold, which is a
      frame-time, speech-pacing and pass-whoosh question and an owner call.

- [x] **Traffic drives the road it is ON, not the road it was drawn on**
      (2026-08-24, owner report: "I have to brake when I am in the only lane
      available and it forces me to brake ... it happens far too often").
      A bubble vehicle's speed was drawn once, from the number posted in the
      cell it appeared in, and kept for life. A US route drops to thirty
      through every town it passes, so a car drawn in one carried thirty out
      onto the sixty-five beyond it, and a car drawn on the open road held
      sixty-five into the next town. `TrafficVehicle` now stores the DRAW --
      the driver's offset from whatever is posted, their machine's limiter,
      and the rush-hour slowdown -- and re-reads the posting under the wheels
      every update. Weather comes off live rather than frozen at spawn.

      Measured before and after over the same 5 200 seeded miles: forced
      slow-downs fell from 1.01 to 0.64 per hundred miles where the road has
      one lane your side, and from 0.63 to 0.30 where it has two or more.
      Bubble vehicles running slower than any speed their own road could draw
      fell from 1.4 percent to 0.1 percent, and the population above 1.2 times
      the posted number (a highway speed carried into a town, up to 3.3 times
      posted) fell from 2 200 sightings to 80. Vehicles PLACED per hundred
      miles went 41.7 to 42.1: the road carries exactly as much traffic as it
      did, which is the invariant `the_road_still_has_traffic_on_it` pins.

      Landed with it: braking traffic is gated on `braking_plausible_at` in
      BOTH spawners (`spawn_initial_traffic` never checked, and `replenish`
      exempted the first three miles of every run, so a phantom wave with no
      cause line to offer was routine); the braking LABEL now ends when the
      reason does, instead of following a recovered vehicle for life; the
      route's opening traffic takes an exit like the rolling bubble's always
      has, instead of being permanent; and a vehicle's LANE is held to the
      lanes its road has, drawn and re-checked, where "passing traffic lives
      in the left lane" used to be applied to two-lane US routes that have no
      left lane. That last one moved the one-lane rate the OTHER way, 0.60 to
      0.64, because a vehicle in a lane that does not exist could never hold
      the truck up -- which is the honest direction for it to move.

      The response half of it -- "in those situations you'd brake hard" -- is
      the next entry, and is closed.

      Finished 2026-08-25: the label expiry above was only asked in the
      far-gap arm of the vehicle update, so it could not fire while a vehicle
      was within 1.8 miles of the truck -- inside the 2.2 the cue announces
      in. The one braking vehicle a driver could actually hear about was the
      one whose label could never end: held at 45 percent of the posting with
      no jam under it, cued as brake lights with no cause to name. The
      question is asked at every gap now. Alongside it, `braking_zones` is
      handed to the manager BEFORE it runs rather than after, so it no longer
      drives a tick on the previous tick's zone list -- on the first tick of a
      trip, on no list at all, which stripped the label off a queue injected
      into a jam. Both surfaced only when ff-core became buildable again: its
      tests had not run all day.

- [x] **`dodgeable` means "is there somewhere to go", and nothing else**
      (2026-08-24, the open half of the entry above). A lead-vehicle hazard
      was emitted `dodgeable: true` whatever the road, so `hazard_deadline_for`
      added `LANE_TAP_CHANGE_S` to the window of a driver who had no lane to
      tap into: the assist waited out two and a half seconds of allowance for
      a move that could not be made while the truck kept closing, and the
      driver who could NOT go around was left nearer the vehicle in front
      before anything acted than the driver who could.

      Done in the order the trap demands. FIRST the target was untangled from
      dodgeability -- `hazard_target_mph` now reads a `HazardShape`, keying
      on `lead_mph` for a vehicle, then on `in_lane` for a thing lying in the
      lane (near stop), and only otherwise on `HAZARD_SAFE_MPH`. Reverting
      just that half and re-running the new file reproduces Brandon's
      2026-08-23 regression exactly: "a vehicle doing 55 must clear at 55
      whatever the road offers -- left: 25.0". THEN `dodgeable` was made to
      mean what it says, at the emitter, for every hazard kind alike:
      `hazard_is_in_lane(kind) && has_open_adjacent_lane_at(None)`. The words
      and the physics read the same predicate now, which
      `the_words_and_the_physics_read_the_same_lane_authority` pins.

      Fixed obstacles came with it, on the owner's ruling that "we should be
      able to swerve around some fixed obstacles": debris beside an open lane
      is dodgeable and the call says so, debris with no lane is the near stop
      and the resolution line no longer claims the truck eased around
      something on a road with nothing to ease into. The catalog flag was
      renamed `HazardDef::dodgeable` -> `in_lane` (and `hazard_is_dodgeable`
      -> `hazard_is_in_lane`) because it never answered the dodge question;
      it answers whether the thing occupies one lane. Fog, ice, a crosswind, a
      dust storm, a deer that may bolt either way and traffic stopped across
      the road stay brake-only however many lanes there are, and keep "Brake
      now!" to themselves.

      Measured on the same rigging as the entry above, 120 seeded deliveries
      over 20 corridors, weather pinned, before and after. Where the road has
      one lane your side: the window granted at the call 14.32 s -> 8.32 s,
      the assist actually had to act on 19 of 32 -> 26 of 30, and the ground
      covered before it did 3 025 ft -> 1 268 ft past the vehicle. Where the
      road has two or more: 16.19 s -> 10.46 s, 15 of 31 -> 29 of 34,
      3 286 ft -> 1 752 ft. Forced slow-downs did not rise on the road the
      report was about (32 -> 30, 0.67 -> 0.63 per hundred miles); on wider
      roads 31 -> 34 (0.48 -> 0.52), which is inside the counting noise of a
      Poisson rate at n = 31 (+/- 5.6) and comes from the truck's own changed
      speed trace, not from more traffic being placed.

      The paired bench (`assist_response_paired_bench`) is the clean read,
      because only the lane count differs. Truck at 65, a car doing 45. BEFORE
      the two roads were identical in every number: window 14.89 s both, the
      assist first acting 11.95 s after the call, by which time the truck was
      194 ft PAST the car it was braking for. AFTER: one lane 6.61 s and the
      assist acting 3.18 s after the call with the car still 28 ft ahead; two
      lanes 9.11 s and 5.83 s, exactly `LANE_TAP_CHANGE_S` apart. Sooner and
      firmer where there is no way past, which is what was asked for. The
      emergency application was not spent in any bench run, and once in 64
      field events (a 3.5 percent grade) -- the escalation rule itself is
      untouched and still measures the stop actually underway.

      OPEN, found by the measurement and NOT this entry's to fix: a
      lead-vehicle hazard is a TIMER, and its countdown has no relation to
      the geometry. The truck drives clean through the vehicle it is being
      warned about -- mean 1 268 ft past it on one lane, and the modelled
      collision only happens if the deadline runs out. That is a defensible
      simplification for an audio-first game, but it means "time to collision"
      and "closing distance" cannot both be true at once, and a driver who
      hears a car right ahead and then passes through it is being told
      something the world does not honour. Deriving the deadline from the
      closing rate, or making bubble traffic solid in your own lane, is an
      owner call: it changes what every traffic warning means.


- [x] **The one-in-four keeper-ease flake, fixed at its three roots**
      (2026-08-20, was: 15.47 against a <= 15.0). Traced with a frame
      trace, not a guess. (1) `_keeper_ease_mi`'s 0.75-mi cap clipped the
      PHYSICAL shed its own docstring promises is a floor, so long-route
      time scales made the number unreachable -- the cap now trims only
      the discretionary reaction budget. (2) While easing toward a lower
      sign, the throttle rebuild between snubs could push speed back
      through the sign's own number; the keeper now coasts at that
      boundary instead of burning fuel to defeat its own easing.
      (3) The assertion demanded an instantaneous <= 15.0 at one milepost,
      but the keeper HOLDS a number by riding a designed snub ripple, so
      the sign was a phase detector on the snub cycle; the test now
      asserts the band the snub polices plus a ripple floor at the number.
      0 failures in 20 randomized runs after; the variance source was the
      fresh-career route draw (each drawn route's time compression), found
      only after two wrong theories died to measurements.

- [x] **Facility approach zones: one posted limit for the chain, changed
      once at the gate (2026-08-21).** Root cause was never the overlap
      geometry -- it was that the per-leg speeds are not readings at all.
      `_resolve_speed` in `tools/build_local_geometry.py` assumes 25 for a
      named street and 15 for an unnamed public road wherever OSM carries no
      `maxspeed`, and the shipped layer is that fallback essentially end to
      end: all 11,732 named segments are exactly 25 and 1,477 of 1,478
      unnamed ones are exactly 15. Half the segments are also under 0.2 mi,
      shorter than any published speed zone (TxDOT wants a zone "as long as
      possible" and 0.200 mi even for a transition; Ohio DOT sets 0.5 mi for
      a new non-contiguous zone). So the chain now builds ONE access-road
      zone at the highest limit its legs offer, plus the gate zone -- two
      zones, one real change, and the deliberate overlap at the gate is the
      only one left. Owner playtest 2026-08-21 ("a message says speed 15 and
      the speed never changes") and the New Haven tester log below are the
      same bug. Per-street zones can return the day the bake carries real
      `maxspeed` WITH its provenance; until then the layer has nothing to
      post per street.

      THE ORIGINAL REPRODUCTION WAS A REAL LOG, not a bench:
      `C:/ff-tester/FreightFate/logs/game.log`, New Haven, Sargent Drive
      approach, keeper set at 25. Read it with `grep -a` (padded). The
      damning nine milliseconds:

        14:24:57  "Speed limit 25 miles per hour, in a facility access road zone."
        14:25:08   15 mph                                  <- already slowed
        14:25:12  "In three quarters of a mile, facility access road ahead. Speed limit 15."
        14:25:12  quiet silenced: "Entering facility access road zone. Speed limit 15 now."
        14:25:15  quiet silenced: "Posted limit lower; speed keeper easing to 15"
        14:25:27  "Speed limit 25 miles per hour, in a facility access road zone."

      The same instant says the 15 zone is 0.75 mi AHEAD and that it is in
      force NOW. The limit under the wheels was 25 throughout.

      The "each leg owns its stretch exclusively" fix written here was
      aimed at the wrong layer: tidying overlap between zones that should
      not have existed would have kept announcing the name gap as a sign.

      DO NOT bench this with hand-written zones. Four synthetic benches over
      two sessions all came back CLEAN because tidy non-overlapping zones
      were written by hand every time; the bug lived only in what
      `_facility_speed_zones` actually produces. The pin is
      `test_the_access_road_posts_one_limit_and_the_gate`, which walks the
      real baked chain and asserts the posted limit changes exactly once.

- [x] **Leaving a facility: the acceleration lane, and three faults under one
      tester report (2026-08-21).** Brandon reported the truck stopping at the
      merge with cruise refusing until he got rolling again. Three separate
      causes, all real, found by driving a genuine departure chain out of
      Aberdeen rather than by reading:
      1. The gate zone was placed on the chain's LAST stretch. Correct
         inbound; driven outbound that stretch is the on-ramp, so the game
         posted 15 exactly where the truck should have been winding up. A
         `Trip` now knows which way its chain is being driven.
      2. There was no acceleration lane at all -- the streets handed straight
         to the highway. One now exists, sized from AASHTO Green Book Table
         10-3 (via TxDOT Roadway Design Manual Table 3-13) with AASHTO's own
         grade multipliers, and the truck's own curve from Long, TRR 1737
         (2000). Keeping both sources is deliberate: the lane is sized for a
         passenger car and the truck is a truck, so merging BELOW highway
         speed is the designed outcome, not a fault. The Green Book's own
         target is 75 percent of highway speed and the CDL manual answers
         slow acceleration with a bigger gap, not more speed.
      3. The stop pause outlived its stop. An arrival pause is deliberately
         never lifted by the resume path -- only a departure clears one -- and
         nothing cleared it, so the pause earned by arriving to load followed
         the driver onto the road. Pulling out of the gate clears it now.
      And a fourth found while verifying: the trip swap lands late in the
      frame, so for one tick the new road read as open highway and the keeper
      handed to cruise, which cannot hold below its minimum speed. The truck
      coasted the entire lane at zero throttle. The keeper takes the lane
      directly now.

      MEASURED, not assumed: out of Aberdeen the truck went from coasting the
      lane at zero throttle to working it at 0.42-0.50 throttle and gaining
      speed the whole way.

- [x] **The acceleration-lane keeper yields to cruise on evidence, not at the
      taper (2026-08-26).** Brandon's associated log pinned the remaining case:
      an automatic yard mule pulling flatbed 2607 with 25 tons of heavy
      machinery, leaving Carlisle Dry Warehouse for I-76 West toward Pittsburgh
      in clear weather on a 1.1-percent downgrade. The cab announced 1,600 feet
      toward a 70-mph road; the truck was 31 mph shortly after the call and 46
      at the lane ending while the keeper's target was already 70.

      Root cause: the ramp still used the keeper's gentle steady-zone trim for
      a time-limited acceleration job, and cruise waited for the lane to end.
      The keeper now asks the real drivetrain for full throttle while materially
      below the merge target. At lane entry a cloned truck state predicts the
      taper capability using the actual tractor, payload, trailer, transmission,
      wear, weather effects, mapped grade, and physical lane length. Cruise takes
      over at AASHTO's 75-percent-of-mainline target only when the capability
      model says the truck can reach it. Otherwise the keeper stays flat out
      through the taper. The live truck still drives every foot through normal
      physics.

      The same 75-percent target replaces the unexplained fixed 12-mph recovery
      band. A truck that physical limits leave below it still hears the big-gap
      warning and stays on the real clock while it builds speed on the mainline.
      Pinned by the exact Carlisle player transcript plus a contrasting empty
      standard rig and focused capability tests.

- [x] **A held-back truck explains itself at dispatch (2026-08-21).** The
      carrier caps the fleet tier by dispatch trust, and `equipment_hold_text`
      has said so well for a while -- its own docstring calls this "the most
      frequent moment in the whole change and the easiest to read as a bug".
      It was unreachable for the drivers who hit it: `_slip_seat_note`
      returned early for anyone past `DEDICATED_TRUCK_LEVEL`, so from level 9
      up the dispatch moment said nothing and the reason lived only on the
      standing readout. Brandon, level 11 and capped to regional, drew a yard
      mule every long haul and asked what gives. The note now speaks the hold
      text for a dedicated driver and stays silent for one in good standing.

      AND SOMEWHERE HE CAN GO AND ASK (2026-08-22). Brandon re-tested and
      reported the career stats screen still silent on it, which is the same
      gap one layer up: both the dispatch note and the withheld level-up are
      MOMENTS, and a moment the player had to be present for is not a record.
      That screen exists to answer "where do I stand" and did not mention
      equipment at all. It now carries what the driver is in and which tier
      it belongs to, the hold and what clears it when there is one, and
      otherwise the level that earns the next tier -- so the question is
      answerable at any time, not only when the game happens to raise it.

- [x] **A vehicle hazard clears at the vehicle's speed (2026-08-23).**
      Brandon: cruise "drops speed dramatically to say something like 40 mph
      or 39 mph and never comes back up". Two wrong diagnoses before his log
      arrived -- the descent ratchet (his set speed was 70 in all 135
      readouts, so it never fired) and a braking-NPC deadlock (benched at
      posted 75 with no zone: no difference, change reverted unshipped).

      HIS LOG, I-70 East in Kansas, level road, limit 75, cruise set 70:
      sixteen "Change lanes or brake! Brake lights right ahead" in ninety
      minutes, a median 112 seconds apart, each resolving only at
      `HAZARD_CREEP_MPH` -- a near stop -- and each followed by "Resuming
      automatic speed control at 70". A loaded truck needs over a minute to
      climb 40 to 70, so he lived at 37 to 40 and cruise looked broken.

      `dodgeable` was doing two jobs: "you can steer around this" and "this
      is not moving, so nearly stop". Both true of a tyre carcass, only the
      first true of a truck doing 55. `_hazard_target_mph` now takes the
      lead's own speed when the hazard is a vehicle, floored at the creep
      speed so stopped traffic still asks for a stop, and folding a fixed
      obstacle in takes the group back to the near stop.

      THE FREQUENCY IS UNTOUCHED and may still want looking at: 13 hazards
      an hour is a lot of interstate drama. It stopped mattering once each
      one cost a lift rather than a stop, so it is recorded rather than
      tuned.

- [x] **Descent brake capture stops rewriting the set speed (2026-08-23).**
      Brandon: cruise "won't speed back up to highway speed... maintaining a
      speed of forty nine mph or lower and losing speed". Reproduced exactly,
      including his number.

      Braking on a downgrade with descent control on balanced or interactive
      assigned straight into `_cruise_mph`. Permanent AND cumulative: 65 to 55
      on one hill, 49 on the next, and no recovery on the flat because 49 IS
      the set speed by then. A ratchet that only turns down.

      THIS BUG WAS ALREADY FIXED ONCE, one branch over. The interactive
      ceiling carries a comment saying exactly this -- "a cap that lives as
      long as the grade does, not a rewrite of the driver's set speed... one
      3 percent dip on a 65 road knocked cruise down to 55 permanently"
      (2026-07-25) -- and the braking-capture path beside it was missed out of
      the correction. It now writes `_cruise_descent_mph`, released with the
      grade like every other descent cap, and takes the lower of any cap
      already standing so the automatic ceiling cannot undo a deliberate
      brake a frame later.

      `test_descent_control_levels_and_brake_capture` pinned the OLD contract
      and was updated; the lesson is that a sibling branch sharing a bug needs
      the fix and the test, not just the one that was reported.

- [x] **Curve advisories count the bank the road is built with
      (2026-08-23).** Owner: too many interstate curves make the truck slow.
      MEASURED: 16,038 interstate mainline curves over 86,412 miles, 3,002 of
      them demanding a drop below 65 -- one every 28.8 miles, where a real
      interstate asks for none.

      The bake computes its advisory as `sqrt(0.30 g R)`, a FLAT road
      (`tools/straw_curve_sample.py`, `A_LAT_G`). TxDOT Roadway Design Manual
      4.7.3 gives the governing equation as `e + f = V^2 / 15R`, so a flat
      reading discards e outright and understates every banked curve: a
      1,000 ft radius reads 67 mph against a designed-and-banked 75.

      `superelevation_at` derives the bank the designer had to build to hold
      the road's own design speed, and `advisory_with_bank_mph` reprices the
      advisory at load. Applied only at design speeds of 50 and up, which is
      where TxDOT Table 4-3 and Iowa DOT 2B-1 both put the Method 5 / Method 2
      line -- a town street is built to normal crown and its flat reading is
      correct. Result: one slowdown every 44.2 interstate miles, from 28.8.

      SOURCES CROSS-CHECKED, at the owner's insistence and he was right to.
      An early WebFetch summary of TxDOT Table 4-7 was WRONG -- shifted a
      column, giving 70 mph as 1,480 ft when the table says 1,810 -- and was
      caught by back-solving its own friction factors (0.14 at 70 is a 50 mph
      value). Read verbatim afterwards. The friction table already in
      `curves.py` matches Iowa DOT Table 2B.1, which cites AASHTO Green Book
      7th ed. Table 3-7, at every speed; and `min_radius_ft` reproduces TxDOT
      Table 4-7 to rounding (757.6 vs 758, 1814.8 vs 1810) by independent
      arithmetic.

      6 PERCENT, NOT 8. `SUPERELEVATION_MAX` is 8 because the SCREEN wants the
      most permissive number. Reusing it for the advisory credits every road
      with the steepest bank any state permits, reading out a higher safe
      speed than the road has. Both manuals name the built rate and both say
      6 (TxDOT 4.7.3; Iowa 2B-2), so `SUPERELEVATION_BUILT` is its own
      constant. Measured sensitivity: 4 vs 6 percent moves 30 percent of
      advisories and 725 across the slow-down line, so this is not a rounding
      detail.

      STATE RULES CONVERGE, which is why there is no per-state table. Texas,
      Iowa, New York and North Carolina all land on 8 as the ceiling, 6 built,
      4 urban, because all four implement AASHTO. The axis that moves the
      number is urban versus rural, not the state line -- and TxDOT settles
      the case that matters: "Freeway facilities are excluded from using a
      maximum superelevation rate of 4 percent."

- [x] **A curve is on the interstate only if the road under it is
      (2026-08-23).** The bank fix took one-every-28.8-miles to
      one-every-44.2. What was left was not a physics problem: EVERY one of
      the original 3,002 sat below the 60 mph minimum radius and half below
      the 50 mph one, so none of them was real interstate mainline. They were
      interchange vertices and city-departure kinks the dense sweep classed
      as mainline rather than as connectors.

      WHY THE SWEEP GOT IT WRONG: `connector` was decided by POSITION alone
      -- `CONNECTOR_WINDOW_MI`, the first and last 0.75 mi of the leg. That
      window cannot see a mid-leg interchange, and 0.75 mi does not get a
      truck out of a town, let alone out of Denver. Everything past it was
      mainline by default.

      THE FIX IS A READING, AND IT IS IN THE BAKE.
      `tools/curve_osm_facts.py` streams the local Geofabrik extracts and
      records what OSM way sits under each curve's apex;
      `tools/bake_curve_connectors.py` sets the flag from its class and
      writes which reading did it into `connector_source`. Two readings,
      both of them upstream's own words:

      * `osm:ramp` -- the apex rides a `highway=*_link` way, which is the tag
        OSM uses for a ramp, slip road or interchange connector.
      * `osm:off-freeway` -- the leg is Interstate class and the apex rides
        something that is not `highway=motorway`. Every Interstate mainline
        mile is a controlled-access freeway by statute (23 CFR 625 adopts the
        AASHTO Interstate design standards) and US mappers tag controlled
        access as `motorway`, so an apex on a `trunk`, `primary` or
        `residential` way is not on the Interstate, whatever the leg says.

      SCREENING AT THE DESIGN FLOOR DOES NOT WORK, and this was tried:
      `INTERSTATE_MIN_RADIUS_FT` raised from 300 to `min_radius_ft(50)` = 758
      reads correctly and deletes I-70 through Glenwood Canyon, which really
      does bend tighter than standard under design exceptions.
      `test_glenwood_canyon_interstate_curves_survive` caught it and the
      change was reverted. A screen sized to the design floor cannot tell an
      exception from an artifact. The rule that shipped never sees a radius,
      a deflection or an advisory at all -- there is no argument through
      which the geometry could reach it -- so it cannot repeat that mistake,
      and `test_a_freeway_curve_stays_mainline_however_hard_it_bends` pins
      that.

      SEPARATION MEASURED on Alabama and Colorado, 1,026 interstate mainline
      rows with readings, against the one thing the rule may not see:

          rule                      slow moved   fast moved   Youden J
          link only                    23%           5%         0.17
          link + shield ref match      72%          19%         0.52
          link + motorway class        72%          15%         0.58  <-- ships

      Shield matching loses both ways: it moves the last stretch of I-59 into
      New Orleans, which really does ride I-10 mainline, and it MISSES the
      business route through Glenwood Springs, which OSM tags
      `ref=I 70 Business` and any number match reads as I-70.

      HAND-CHECKED on the I-70 legs, because that is where a bad rule would
      show first. What moved: Edwards Access Road, "I 70 Business" through
      Edwards and Glenwood Springs, Pine Street, West 6th Street, Laurel
      Street, Ute Avenue, South 12th Street, Blue River Parkway, and a string
      of `motorway_link` ramps. What did not move: every mile of Glenwood
      Canyon between them.

      RESULT: one interstate slowdown every 130.7 miles, from 44.2 -- 1,954
      demands to come off the pace down to 661, over the same 86,412 miles.
      13,479 rows moved off mainline network-wide (connectors 8,439 ->
      21,918), read for 99.8 percent of the 63,873 baked curves; the 130
      with no road inside the corridor keep whatever the sweep said.
      Mountain interstate is intact: Glenwood Canyon keeps 70 of its 71
      curves and 20 of its 21 slow ones, Vail Pass 59 of 60, the Eisenhower
      approach 76 of 82, Glenwood Springs to Grand Junction 54 of 60 -- and
      what each of them lost was town street or ramp at the leg's ends, not
      canyon. US-550 over Red Mountain Pass is untouched at 276 curves and
      the Salt River Canyon at 143. The interstate legs that still ask for a
      slow-down are the ones that should: I-5 through the Siskiyous, I-40
      through the Pigeon River Gorge, I-90 over Lookout Pass, I-84 in the
      Columbia Gorge, I-64 and I-77 in West Virginia. Nothing was deleted:
      every row keeps its radius, deflection and advisory, and
      `connector_source` says which reading moved it.

      CONNECTORS ARE ONLY EVER ADDED -- a row the positional window flagged
      stays flagged, because the window sees city geometry the class reading
      can miss. Re-running the tool on its own output lands in the same
      place: only the sweep's own verdict is preserved, never this tool's.

      WHAT IT STILL KEEPS, measured rather than assumed: of the 15,752
      interstate mainline rows that survive, 11,986 sit on a way carrying the
      leg's own shield, 3,640 on a way carrying another route number (a
      concurrency, or a leg that genuinely finishes on a different freeway --
      I-59 into New Orleans rides I-10), and 126 on a `motorway` way with no
      `ref` at all. That last group is where the rule cannot tell "a freeway"
      from "the Interstate", and it is urban freeway spaghetti: the
      Whitehurst Freeway in DC, the West 6th Avenue Freeway out of Denver,
      Tampa's Crosstown Connector, the I-95 Express Toll Lanes. 37 of them
      ask a truck to slow and the existing 300 ft interstate screen takes
      most of those at load, leaving roughly twenty of 661. They are real
      bends on real controlled-access road, so they are LEFT rather than
      chased with a second rule -- but that is the residual, and this is
      where to look if the interstate ever feels talkative in a city again.

- [x] **A bend is judged against the road its leg is MADE of (2026-08-23).**
      The connector rule keyed off the leg's LABEL -- "this leg says I-65, so
      anything not `motorway` is off the freeway". On 36 legs the label is
      wrong and the rule silenced 2,677 real bends, US-231's among them.

      Turning the rule off for those legs was tried and is worse: it restores
      the real trunk bends together with Brickell Avenue in downtown Miami at
      a 38 ft radius. A coverage percentage was tried too and is forbidden --
      the freeway-coverage histogram is NOT bimodal (52 interstate legs sit
      between 40 and 60 percent), so any cut would have been chosen to look
      right.

      `corridor_class` reads what the leg is made of instead, as an argmax
      over its per-mile road classes -- no number to tune -- and a bend is
      off-corridor when it rides a road LESS important than that. A leg made
      of motorway keeps only motorway bends (the Interstate case, unchanged
      for 692 of 728). A leg made of trunk keeps its trunk bends and drops
      the town it threads.

      HAND-CHECKED, and it separates what terrain could not: US-550 loses
      Town Plaza and Greene Street in Silverton and keeps all 274 of its
      switchbacks; US-40 loses Denver's 14th Avenue Parkway and Salt Lake's
      Main Street; Huntsville to Nashville loses Southside Square and keeps
      92 US-231 bends. Of 18,340 off-corridor rows, 1,183 sit on HPMS
      mountainous legs and 42 of those turn like a switchback -- every one a
      named town street, North Pack Square in Asheville among them, looping
      260 to 368 degrees. None is a road switchback.

      TWO TESTS WERE PINNED TO THE WRONG RECORDS and are re-pinned. The
      "mountain switchback at mile 2.48" out of Hazard is `KY 15 Business`,
      an 80 ft street corner turning 71 degrees; the "real switchback within
      the first mile" of US-119 out of Charleston is Thayer Street. Both
      legs' actual through roads survive.

      RESULT: one interstate slowdown every 107.1 miles, against 44.2 before
      any of this work. Lower than the 130.7 the label-gated rule reported,
      and that number was flattered by silencing real road.

- [x] **Leg mileages that fell short of their own road are corrected
      (2026-08-23).** 176 legs stored a distance below the length of the
      route they were baked from; 36 were below the STRAIGHT LINE between
      their two city nodes, which no road can be. Total 13,337 -> 14,948 mi.

      Nothing caught it because nothing disagreed: the corridor bake rescales
      every layer onto `leg.miles`, so grades ended exactly at the stored
      figure and `state_miles` summed to it. Same number, different hats. The
      straight-line check is now a test, because it is the one witness that
      owes the data nothing.

      The corrected value is the geometry archive's length, and it is a
      PROVEN lower bound: the archive is a Douglas-Peucker subset, and
      dropping a vertex replaces a path with its chord, which is never
      longer. So a leg below it is short of a floor. Legs above it are left
      alone. The half mile of slack is integer rounding, not a threshold --
      the shortfall distribution has no gap to cut at.

      `tools/repair_leg_mileage.py` carried 49,128 along-route positions
      across 15 field types and four shards, and REFUSES to run on a
      mileage-looking field it does not know. `landmarks[].off_mi` is
      excluded on purpose: it is distance OFF the road.

      KNOWN AND ACCEPTED: the archive understates by about 0.1 percent, so a
      corrected leg still reads a touch short. A real router would settle it
      exactly -- see the Valhalla bullet below.

- [x] **Curve road classes come from a map matcher, not from nearest-way
      (2026-08-23).** `curve_osm_facts.py` streamed 14 GB of Geofabrik
      extracts and took the nearest way segment to each curve's apex. That is
      the wrong instrument: at an interchange the ramp and the mainline it
      leaves are metres apart, and one point cannot know which the truck is
      on. Two 90-minute passes to get an answer that was wrong at exactly the
      places it mattered.

      Valhalla's `trace_attributes` snaps the WHOLE polyline at once, so the
      answer has to be a connected path, and it separates two things OSM
      conflates into `highway=*_link`: `road_class` (the road's importance)
      and `use` (whether the edge is a ramp or turn channel). A ramp off a
      trunk is now a ramp CARRYING trunk class.

      NO TILESET NEEDED, which was the surprise. FOSSGIS runs a public,
      planet-wide Valhalla that answers `trace_attributes`; a local US build
      was started, would have taken 6-12 hours and ~120 GB, and was abandoned
      once the public service matched 400 of 400 points through Glenwood
      Canyon in 0.7 seconds. The whole network now matches in about forty
      minutes, throttled to be a good citizen. `--local` still points at a
      self-hosted build if one is ever wanted.

      THE BUG THE 2 PERCENT GUARD CAUGHT: Valhalla caps a trace by PATH
      DISTANCE (200 km), not by point count. Chunking by points let a leg with
      1 km vertex spacing blow the limit in 257 points and come back ENTIRELY
      unmatched -- 24 percent of Colorado, five legs at 100 percent. Chunking
      by distance took that to 0.2 percent. Without the guard this would have
      shipped as a quietly blind dataset.

      RESULT: 1,290 legs matched, 99.7 percent of 63,873 curves read. One
      interstate slowdown every 105.7 miles. Every control held or improved,
      and two improved because the matcher RECOVERED real bends the
      nearest-way pass had wrongly dropped: US-550 274 -> 276 curves, US-40
      362 -> 368. Glenwood Canyon, Vail Pass, the Eisenhower approach and the
      Salt River Canyon are unchanged to the curve.

      `tools/curve_osm_facts.py` is deleted. Two tools answering the same
      question differently is an invitation to run the wrong one.

- [x] **Terrain reclassified from the elevation archive (2026-08-23).**
      `tools/reclassify_terrain.py` run with `--write`: one leg label firmed
      up (Asheville-Hickory, hills -> mountain, the last piece of the Pigeon
      River Gorge chain) and 711 grade-segment labels corrected -- 478 hills
      to flat, 123 flat to hills, 97 mountain to hills, 13 hills to mountain.

      Its acceptance harness passes: every Texas leg keeps ZERO mountain
      segments (the Hill Country / East Texas fix), the Grapevine, the
      Siskiyous, Monteagle and Denver-Silverthorne all stay mountain at both
      levels, and all 96 runaway ramps still sit on mountain segments. The
      artifact screen was re-run afterwards and moved nothing (370 -> 370).

      THE 141 LEGS LABELLED MOUNTAIN THAT HPMS CALLS LEVEL ARE STILL NOT
      TOUCHED, and that is the tool's own rule rather than an oversight: a
      leg label only ever firms UP, never silently downgrades off a stricter
      geometric read. The label is relief-in-context from the dense profile;
      HPMS is a road-class survey. They measure related but different things,
      and Glenwood Canyon is the standing proof that the two can honestly
      disagree.

- [x] **Legs labelled for a road their route does not ride: the ROUTE half
      fixed (2026-08-23).** A truck router tells the two faults apart. Ask
      Valhalla for the route between the two city nodes and measure how much
      of ITS mileage rides the labelled interstate. A high share means the
      interstate IS the road and the BAKED ROUTE is wrong; a low one means
      the interstate does not serve that pair and the LABEL is wrong.

      THE SPLIT IS NOW A TOOL, not a thing to re-derive by hand.
      `repair_leg_labels.py --split` always wanted a file no tool produced,
      so the measurement had to be reconstructed every time anyone needed it
      -- and reconstructing it is how the reroute set was lost between
      sessions. `tools/probe_leg_labels.py` writes it: suspects come from the
      map-matched coverage in `curve_osm.jsonl`, verdicts from the router.

      THE LABEL HALF is the unchecked bullet below. Five legs with a clear
      majority road have already been renamed (Ashland-Huntington to US-52,
      Cape Coral-Lakeland to US-17, Hickory-Charlotte to NC-16,
      Tyler-Longview to US-271, West Palm Beach-Cape Coral to SR-80). A
      route threading four roads has no honest single name, so a leg with no
      majority is left alone.

      THE ROUTE HALF, now: **24 legs rerouted and fully re-enriched**, among
      them Chicago to St Louis (96 percent I-55 by the router, 19 percent
      baked), Beaumont to Houston (93 percent I-10), Charleston to Pittsburgh
      (93 percent I-79), Corpus Christi to San Antonio (88 percent I-37) and
      Norfolk to Richmond (82 percent I-64).

      IT IS 24 AND NOT THE 30 THIS ENTRY USED TO SAY, for two reasons worth
      recording rather than quietly reconciling. The truck profile changed
      underneath the measurement -- routing as a loaded 80,000 lb semi rather
      than Valhalla's 48,000 lb default moves real routes -- and the 14-point
      hole the old split was read off has CLOSED: today's distribution runs
      0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 4 4 6 7 11 12 13 ... 88 93 93 96 with its widest
      gap 19 points up at 54. So the line is no longer read off a gap; it is
      `reroute_leg.MIN_ON_LABEL`, the same 25 percent that tool refuses
      below, which means the probe can never nominate a leg the reroute would
      then refuse.

      MILEAGE MOVED, AND MILEAGE IS PAY. The 24 legs went from 3,655 to
      3,794 miles, +139 (+3.8 percent). Most moved under ten miles; Knoxville
      to Atlanta is +36, Raleigh to Charlotte +25, Norfolk to Richmond -5.
      Pay and deadlines follow, and the changelog says so.

      THE ENRICHMENT WAS THE BLOCKER, and it is what got built.
      `reroute_leg.py` settles the route; `reroute_enrich.py` rebuilds every
      layer keyed to it -- curves, ramps and posted limits via
      `bake_curve_geometry.py --from-archive`, grades from a fresh dense
      Valhalla elevation read, state context from Census boundaries,
      interchanges/restrictions/ramp controls from the local extract,
      landmarks and villages and lanes from Overpass, volume and terrain from
      HPMS. It REFUSES to call a leg finished if a layer came back empty or
      at under half its old size, because a builder that finds nothing and
      exits zero is the failure this job hit twice.

      THREE REAL BUGS CAME OUT OF BUILDING IT:

      * every corridor builder located a leg by straight chords between
        route points 25 miles apart, or by a cached route keyed to the road
        the leg no longer drives. They all read the archived polyline now
        (`tools/leg_geometry.py`), which is the road itself at full curve
        fidelity and is right before and after a reroute;
      * `bake_villages.py` counted its OWN previous output as names already
        taken, so a second run on the same leg dropped every village it found
        the first time -- 29 names down to 3, printed as a success;
      * the Overpass client read a busy server as an empty map. The service
        answers "the server is probably too busy" with a 200 and an HTML
        body, which either crashed the JSON decode or, in the remark form,
        looked like a road with nothing on it.

      THE BOX WAS THE BUG, NOT THE SERVICE. Measured back to back on the same
      leg: half-degree corridor boxes answered "too busy" more often than
      they answered; quarter-degree boxes answered every time in 4 to 25
      seconds. A local-extract reader was built to work around this and then
      DELETED, because a second data path nobody had proved is worse than the
      three-line fix that was actually indicated.

- [x] **Ten legs renamed for the road they actually drive (2026-08-23).**
      The other half of the split above. Re-measured with the loaded-semi
      profile, 33 interstate legs ride their own shield for under a quarter
      of their miles; ten of those have a clear majority road and were
      renamed: Allentown-New York to I-78 (58%), Dover-Wilmington to DE-1
      (54%), Evansville-Nashville to US-431 (70%), Killeen-Temple to US-190
      (50%), Manchester-Providence to I-95 (54%), Pendleton-Tri-Cities to
      US-395 (80%), Portsmouth-Manchester to NH-101 (65%), San Jose-
      Sacramento to I-680 (59%), Trenton-Philadelphia to I-95 (52%),
      Winston-Salem-Greensboro to US-421 (56%).

      IT IS A NAMING FIX, NOT A CURVE FIX, and the first version of this
      entry said otherwise. Measured: the ten renamed legs carry ONE spoken
      interstate curve call between them. The 21 calls that do come from
      mislabelled legs sit almost entirely on two legs with no majority road
      -- Roanoke to Raleigh (16) and Burlington to Albany (4) -- which are in
      the left-alone set below and are not renamed. Worth stating plainly
      because the wrong number was used to justify doing this work.

      THE OTHER 23 thread several roads and have no honest single name --
      Tampa to Miami's best is SR-70 at 35 percent, Burlington to Albany's is
      VT-22 at 32. A 30 percent plurality is wrong more quietly, not less, so
      those want a decision rather than a tool.

      TWO SHIELD MATCHERS, ON PURPOSE. `scs.matches_shield` collapses every
      state route to one class so "State Highway 6" and "TX 6" compare equal,
      which is right for asking whether a matched road IS the leg's road.
      `repair_leg_labels.shield` keeps the written prefix, because its answer
      becomes the leg's NAME and a player hears it: "NH-101", never
      "STATE-101". Checked against each other on every relabel candidate --
      the shares agree to the point, only the spelling differs.

- [x] **Too many bends called on the interstate: measured, and mostly the
      wrong-road bug (2026-08-23).** Reported from the 2026-08-22 tester
      build. Measured with the game's own loader, counting only bends that
      would actually ask a truck at 65 to slow:

          that build (f4c19468)   1,440 calls   one every  60 miles
          branch head             238 calls     one every 363 miles

      So six sevenths of it was already fixed and unshipped -- the map-matched
      connector read is not in any build yet.

      WHERE THE REMAINING 238 COME FROM, by asking the map matcher what road
      each one is actually on: 159 are on ``motorway`` and are real interstate
      geometry; 79 are on ``trunk`` or a street, and the matcher knew it.
      Of those 79, 56 are on legs REROUTED above -- Huntsville to Nashville
      alone carries 34, every one of them a bend in US-231 through
      Shelbyville announced as I-65. The remaining 23 sit on legs whose label
      is wrong and whose route has no honest single name to replace it with,
      16 of them on Roanoke to Raleigh.

      TWO SCREENS TRIED AND BOTH REVERTED. A radius floor at the design
      minimum was tried before this and took I-70 out of Glenwood Canyon. A
      per-SEGMENT version of the same floor, using each leg's own dense
      elevation profile instead of the whole-corridor HPMS class, was tried
      here: it cut spoken interstate calls from 238 to 135, and it took
      Glenwood Canyon from 70 curves to 52 and I-70 west of Glenwood from 53
      to 18. Reverted. The canyon road follows the river at a mild grade, so
      the profile calls its ground flat while the walls force the bends --
      grade is not the discriminator, and two independent attempts now say
      the same thing. `bake_curve_connectors` reached this conclusion first
      and wrote it down: the remedy for a leg whose bends are not on its own
      road is to fix the leg, not to add a screen. Chasing the last twenty
      records with a third rule would be fitting to the residual.

      THE MEASUREMENT IS THE POINT. "Bends baked" (16,038 in that build) is
      not what a driver hears; "bends that speak at cruising speed" is, and
      the two move differently. Any future claim about curve noise wants the
      second number.

- [x] **Congestion stopped being a wall in the same place every run
      (2026-08-24).** Owner-reported after the reroute: traffic zones felt
      predictable. Measured, they were -- across 300 seeds Chicago to St
      Louis produced exactly ONE heavy-traffic layout, and Dallas to Houston
      one. That was by design, since congestion is read from HPMS volume
      against capacity rather than rolled, and the design's answer to
      predictability was the clock. Measured, that answer was thin: mile 5
      to 35 out of Chicago ran slow from 06:00 to 18:00, so any daylight run
      met it.

      THE FIX IS IN THE VOLUME MODEL, not sprinkled on top of it. AADT is an
      ANNUAL AVERAGE and no day is the average -- the FHWA Traffic Monitoring
      Guide's day-of-week and monthly adjustment factors exist for exactly
      that spread. Day-of-week was already modelled, so what was missing was
      the residual day-to-day scatter: one draw per stretch per trip at a 10
      percent coefficient of variation, applied both when the zone forms and
      when it is asked whether it applies. An oversaturated stretch still
      backs up every day because no ordinary day clears a ratio that far
      over the line; a marginal one falls under on a quiet day.

      MEASURED AFTER: Chicago to St Louis went from 1 layout across 300 seeds
      to 10, the commonest appearing 177 times rather than 300. The slow
      window went from a fixed 12-13 hours to between zero and fourteen --
      one run finds the jam all day, one finds an hour of it at the evening
      peak, one finds clear road.

      AND A SELF-INFLICTED HALF OF IT: reconciling work zones against jams
      had DELETED any roadworks drawn near one, which spends exactly the part
      of a slow zone that is meant to vary. The jam's footprint is now
      claimed before the draw, so roadworks relocate instead. Chicago to St
      Louis went from 151 runs in 300 carrying a work zone to 167.

- [ ] **`build_interchanges.py` cannot be imported twice in one process.**
      It merges its sub-modules' namespaces into its own globals at import,
      and those sub-modules are cached, so a second import by path leaves the
      new module holding the FIRST one's functions. A test that monkeypatches
      the module then patches an object nothing calls, and the failure reads
      as a data problem rather than an import one: `discover_leg` quietly
      returns nothing at all. Cost one bisect on 2026-08-23. Until the
      aggregate stops merging namespaces, a test wanting something defined in
      `build_interchanges_base` should load THAT module, not the aggregate
      that re-exports it.

- [ ] **A rerouted leg's curated tolls need re-curating by hand.** A toll
      event is a real plaza on a named road, and a reroute changes the road,
      so `reroute_leg.py` drops them and prints what it dropped rather than
      rescaling a plaza onto pavement that may not charge. None of the 24
      carried any, so nothing is owed today -- but `tollway_detected` is now
      re-read from the router per leg, so the coverage advisory will say when
      one does.

- [x] **`curve_artifacts.jsonl` re-baked against its own screen
      (2026-08-23).** The shipped US/state artifact table had drifted from
      the rule that screens with it. Re-baked: 1,079 flagged rows down to
      771.

      WHAT MOVED, checked row by row rather than assumed: all 309 that
      stopped being flagged are now CONNECTORS, so they were already silent
      and stay silent -- nothing returns to the player, which was the risk
      worth checking before re-baking. One row is newly screened, a 161 ft
      "hairpin" at mile 50.4 of Elberton to Augusta that no through highway
      bends to. So the table now matches its screen at a cost of exactly one
      curve, in the right direction.
- [x] **"Hairpin" is a shape, and the sign manual says which one
      (2026-08-23).** `severity` called anything advising 25 or less a
      hairpin. MUTCD does not: the Hairpin Curve sign (W1-11) is for a change
      in horizontal alignment of 135 degrees or more, and advisory speed
      sorts curves separately and much lower down, swapping the Turn sign
      (W1-1) for the Curve sign at 30 mph or less.

      MEASURED across 33,930 baked curves, three candidate rules:
        * old (advisory <= 25 or deflection >= 150): 159 hairpins, 0 on an
          interstate -- but among them bends deflecting TEN degrees, called
          hairpins purely for being taken slowly.
        * angle alone (deflection >= 135): 99 hairpins, and 7 of them on
          interstate mainline. One is I-49 north of Fayetteville, 811 ft
          radius through 143 degrees at a 60 mph advisory: a real half-circle
          of road, and a sweeping one nobody would call a hairpin.
        * MUTCD, both halves (deflection >= 135 AND advisory <= 30): 46
          hairpins and NONE on an interstate.

      The last is what shipped, and the interstate count is the check on it
      rather than a target it was fitted to -- interstates do not switchback,
      and the rule works that out without being told.

      The artifact screens keep the BROAD test, deliberately: their question
      is "could a road here really do this?", where a very low advisory is an
      extreme claim about the ground whether or not the road comes back on
      itself. One predicate had been answering both questions;
      `tools/screen_curve_artifacts.py` calls its own `_is_extreme_claim` now
      so the two cannot drift into each other again.

- [x] **Curve assist takes the chain's tightest advisory, not the first
      bend's (2026-08-23).** Darren's load shifted 12 percent on NY-12 and
      his log had the words and the machine disagreeing:

        Curve left, a quarter mile. Advise 40 miles per hour. Then sharp
        left, advise 30 miles per hour. Adaptive cruise easing to 40 miles
        per hour for the bend.
        ... Sharp left: too fast, drifting to the outside.
        ... The load has shifted hard and is damaged, 12 percent.

      `_pacenote_text` already reads the linked follower and speaks its
      tighter advisory; the assist beside it read only `advisory` and set
      `_cruise_curve_end_mi` to the LEAD bend's end. So it eased to 40,
      released at the first bend's end, and met a 30 mph bend at 40 -- with
      nothing left to warn, because the trip suppresses a linked follower's
      own call so a chain speaks once. The spoken number was right the whole
      way, which is the worst shape for a fault: nobody goes looking for a
      bug in a cab that is saying the correct thing.

      Found by reading a tester's log rather than by a report -- Darren only
      said he "had some trouble with hairpin curves" and asked whether they
      were supposed to be there.

- [x] **CI stops spending the LFS budget it needs (2026-08-23).** Every run
      on this branch was red at CHECKOUT, not on a test: "This repository
      exceeded its LFS budget". CI was what spent it. The test job fetched
      the whole LFS payload -- music.pak at 250 MB plus sounds.pak at 7.5 MB
      -- on both matrix runners on every push, about half a gigabyte per
      commit, and the build job again on top. Buying quota only postpones
      that: at this push rate a 50 GB data pack lasts roughly ten days.

      The test job now checks out with `lfs: false` and pulls sounds.pak
      alone, which the suite actually reaches for, and never fatally: a quota
      failure leaves the pack unmaterialised rather than failing the run.
      What that costs is four music-asset assertions and the committed
      music.pak header check, which now skip instead -- they are content-pack
      invariants that change rarely and still run on any machine holding the
      pack. Verified by replacing music.pak with a pointer stub locally and
      running the full suite in exactly the state CI will be in.

      A pointer is a file that EXISTS, which is why the helpers had to learn
      to see one: an existence check alone reads an unmaterialised pack as
      present and every asset lookup then fails against something that is not
      a pack. `asset_helpers.pack_available` is that check.

      The build job still takes the full payload, and should: it packages the
      game and genuinely needs the audio.

      EXPECT CI RED UNTIL 2026-09-01, AND DO NOT RE-DIAGNOSE IT. The budget
      was already spent when this landed, so even the 7.5 MB sound pull fails
      and the job runs with no audio at all -- 50 tests across 12 modules
      that need shipped bytes (the engine ring, the horn, loop points, Learn
      Sounds). GitHub's bandwidth allowance resets on the 1st; the pull then
      succeeds and all 50 come back on their own with no code change. Owner
      ruled 2026-08-23 to ride it out rather than buy quota or skip the
      tests, so a red CI in this window means "the quota is still spent"
      until proven otherwise -- but it also means a REAL failure in this
      window is easy to miss, so read the job log rather than the badge.

- [x] **A box truck stops borrowing a tractor-trailer's limiter
      (2026-08-22).** `GOVERNED_CLASSES` put semis and box trucks in one
      band, and the band's provenance is ATRI's Operational Costs survey --
      which asks FOR-HIRE FLEETS RUNNING CLASS 8 TRACTORS. A straight truck
      is not one, so this was a reading about one class reused for another,
      the exact fault the provenance rules are about. The checkable numbers
      for these are published rental and vocational governors (U-Haul states
      55 mph for its trucks, Penske governs at 65), so
      `GOVERNED_BOX_TRUCK_BAND_MPH` is those, and `GOVERNED_BANDS` maps each
      class to its own rather than sharing one.

      MEASURED, because the point was passability and not the number: on a 65
      road, against a player holding the limit, a box truck was 3+ mph slower
      0 percent of the time before (mean 64.2) and 70 percent after (mean
      59.9). That is why Brandon moved to the left lane and stayed level with
      one instead of getting by it.

      AND THE SEMI HALF, ANSWERED BY TERRAIN RATHER THAN BY MOVING A CITED
      NUMBER (owner: "I want to implement whatever is more realistic in
      trucking"). The same measurement said a semi is also 0 percent passable
      on a flat 65 road, and on the flat that is CORRECT: two governed trucks
      a mile an hour apart is the elephant race real drivers complain about,
      and the player's truck is not road-governed anyway (`speed_cap_mph` is
      set only by the damage limp bands), so a driver with road left can
      always use it.

      What was missing was the hill. NPC speed had no grade term at all, so a
      mountain leg ran like Kansas and heavy traffic stayed a wall at one
      speed everywhere. `climb_speed_mph` is the steady state where a class's
      wheel power equals drag plus rolling plus the climb, using the SAME
      constants as the player's truck (`vehicle.resistance_force`) and each
      class's real weight and power. Not a fitted table: the check is that it
      lands where a driver would expect -- a loaded tractor at about 26 mph on
      a sustained 6 percent, 44 on a 3 -- and on I-70 west of Denver 20 of 82
      sampled miles now hold trucks below their limiter, with a box truck
      climbing the steepest pitch at 42 where a semi manages 24.

      NOT DONE, and deliberately: ATRI's 84.1 percent limiter figure is about
      FLEETS, not trucks, so spawning a 16 percent ungoverned minority from it
      would repeat the very substitution this entry is about.

- [x] **Closing the window asks before it takes the drive (2026-08-22).**
      `pygame.QUIT` -- Alt+F4 and the window close button both -- set
      `running = False` on the spot. Mid-leg that is silently destructive:
      saving happens only at stops, so the leg is discarded and the save
      still points at the last stop. Darren lost two routes to a mis-hit key
      and asked for the gate Escape already has. It now raises
      `ConfirmQuitState`, which grew an `unsaved_drive` flag so the question
      is worth reading rather than a keystroke to swat: quitting from the
      title loses nothing and says nothing, quitting mid-leg says what it
      costs in the same words the pause menu's quit already uses. The second
      close request is obeyed without argument -- a confirmation the player
      cannot get past would be a worse bug than the one it fixes.

- [ ] **Audit every interrupting line for whether it is still TRUE when it
      comes back.** A cut line is handed back so it finishes rather than
      vanishing -- Shane asked for that, and it is what rescued the missing
      "you swerve around the brake lights". But a handed-back line that names
      a MOMENT rather than a fact is stale by the time it returns, and four
      have now been fixed one at a time, each after a different tester named a
      different sentence:
        * the scale exit instruction, once the scale is behind (2026-08-21)
        * the destination exit instruction, once the gore is behind
        * the hazard dodge call, once the hazard is clear
        * the dock hold prompt, once the driver has pressed the key
        * the curve call and its cruise clause, once the bend is behind or
          the truck has slowed for it (Shane P, 2026-08-21)
      That is a pattern, and patching it per report is how the next one gets
      found by a tester rather than by us. The work: walk every `say_event`
      with `interrupt=True` and ask whether the sentence is still true a few
      seconds later; where it names a maneuver, a keypress, or a number that
      moves, give it a `valid` callable.

      THE WORKLIST IS SMALLER THAN IT FIRST LOOKED: 78 `say_event` calls in
      `states/` actually interrupt (explicit `interrupt=True` or the default,
      which IS True), 13 of them now gated. 33 are in `driving_events.py` and
      32 in `driving_updates.py`, so two files carry five sixths of it. An
      earlier note here said 201 -- that was `grep -c interrupt=True`, which
      also counts `ctx.say()` calls, other APIs and tests. Brace-match the
      `say_event(` calls instead.

      PROGRESS 2026-08-21, and the method that works: reasoning from the
      source guesses at which lines name a moment. DRIVING them says. The
      requeue log now names the line it hands back (`[pacer] cut line
      requeued: <text>`), which turns any bench transcript into the audit --
      grep the requeues, read each, ask whether it was still true. Four short
      `playtest_road --headless` benches over zones, scales, curves and limit
      drops surfaced three more in twenty minutes: both enforcement stop
      instructions and the overspeed nag, all now gated.

      The sampling is thin -- four benches, four requeues, and one bench
      produced none at all on a re-run with a different seed -- so this
      narrows the worklist rather than closing it. Longer benches across more
      features are the cheap next step before anyone reads the remaining
      sixty-five by hand.

- [x] **Per-exit ramp speed threaded through every exit (SHIPPED
      2026-08-21).** The model landed in 35427880 (`Trip.ramp_speed_at`,
      `ramp_speed_mph`, `deceleration_lane_mi`, AASHTO via TxDOT); the
      threading through every exit site -- stops, destinations, scales --
      followed the same day. Every spoken ramp number, the safe-speed reading,
      the cruise cap and both assists now read the exit's own figure.

      THE CRUX, kept here because it cost a session: TWO NUMBERS, NOT ONE.

        * GORE ACCEPTANCE -- how fast the truck may still be doing when it
          enters the exit. A deceleration lane is a full lane beside the
          through lanes and exists so a driver leaves at ROAD speed and sheds
          inside it. `_gore_acceptance_mph(stop)` is
          `max(RAMP_MAX_MPH, posted limit at the gore + SPEEDING_LEEWAY_MPH)`:
          road speed as the posts judge it, never below the old flat 45 so a
          slow corridor cannot make taking an exit HARDER than it ever was.
          The leeway is the headroom the old 45-over-40 pair had built in;
          judged at the sign's exact number the gate refused its own assist --
          the exit speed assist stands down at acceptance, a downgrade put the
          truck a fraction over with cruise already paused, and it missed.
        * RAMP DESIGN SPEED -- what the truck slows to along the ramp, from
          `Trip.ramp_speed_at`: 85 percent of mainline for a directional
          connector (`ramp_far_end == "motorway"`), 70 percent for one landing
          on a surface road, floored at 30. Automatic control aims
          `RAMP_CRUISE_HEADROOM_MPH` under it.

      Collapsing them is the trap: it made a ramp off a 55 demand 38 where
      the flat rule asked 45, tightening exactly where the change was meant
      to loosen. The other trap is the STOP ARGUMENT: the gore gate and the
      exit callout both run where `_exit_stop` is already cleared or not yet
      set, and without the stop handed in the helpers fall back to the flat
      45 and quietly undo the whole change -- that was the third gate the
      parked note said to look for.

      A driver's own lower cruise setting still beats the ramp's figure: the
      spoken approach target is `min(cruise, exit cap)`. The ramp number is
      a ceiling, not a demand.

      Still open from this: `deceleration_lane_mi` is modelled but unused.
      The ramp is a flat `RAMP_LENGTH_MI` of 0.5 that stands in for the
      deceleration lane plus the ramp proper; sizing the shed from the real
      lane length (and its downhill multiplier) is the next slice.

- [x] **The reverse trap: the throttle latch ate the shift out of reverse
      (FIXED 2026-08-21).** Owner hit it at the I-40 scale mid-playtest --
      "I can't get out of reverse?" -- and the log showed the truck at 0 mph
      in reverse with "Throttle latched / Throttle released" cycling.

      Both gestures live on the throttle key at a standstill. The latch
      catches at `CATCH_HOLD_S` 0.5s; the direction change needs
      `DIRECTION_CHANGE_HOLD_S` 0.6s; and the catch cleared `_direction_armed`
      on the way past, killing the shift a tenth of a second before it would
      have fired. Worse, once latched there is no rising edge left, so it
      could not re-arm at all. The only escape was a single clean hold from
      rest with no tap in front of it, which nothing documents -- and a
      driver pumping the pedal never produces one.

      Now a pending shift back to FORWARD survives the catch: the latch drops
      itself into `manual` instead, so the held key keeps driving the pedal,
      the gear changes, and the truck does not pull away hands-free. Taking
      reverse still loses to the catch, which is the property
      `test_latching_the_brake_at_a_standstill_never_grabs_reverse` pins:
      rolling into reverse is the dangerous direction, ending up in forward
      at a standstill is not.

      The workaround was not enough -- pumping still fought the shared hold
      -- so the throttle latch itself was removed on 2026-08-28. Holding the
      throttle key never catches a latch; the brake latch remains.

      TWO THINGS THE INVESTIGATION GOT WRONG, recorded so the next one does
      not repeat them:

        * "The truck creeps in reverse" was a rig artefact. The yard sits on
          a grade and the bench had not flattened it. Measured properly --
          90 seconds idling, in gear and in reverse, on the level -- creep is
          0.000 m/s both ways. A standstill threshold change was written and
          reverted. Any bench touching a standstill must pin `grade_at` and
          `truck.grade`, exactly as it pins the speed limits.
        * A truck rolling on a grade in reverse still cannot arm the shift,
          because in reverse the brake key means "back up" and there is no
          key that stops you. The parking brake IS the escape and it works.
          Left alone deliberately rather than loosening the threshold on the
          back of a misdiagnosis.

- [x] **Reverse stopped announcing itself (owner ruling, 2026-08-21).** The
      spoken "Reverse selected. Backing slowly." sat on top of the reverse
      beep, which starts at the same instant and runs the whole time the
      truck is in reverse -- a better cue than a one-shot sentence. The line
      is gone from speech; `_status_text` still carries it for the readout,
      and the forward shift still speaks because nothing beeps for it.
      Follow-on: `test_driving_speech_ladder`'s count test anchored its
      non-vacuousness on that line as its CONFIRMATION example. Re-measuring
      the battery, `reverse_down_the_route` now reaches only MONEY,
      NAVIGATION, SAFETY and STATUS, so the anchor is STATUS alone plus a
      check that quiet really cuts it. Thirteen scenarios do still carry both
      categories (`assists_fight_descent`, `floor_it_through_town`,
      `scale_check_in_guidance` among them) if that test ever wants one.

- [x] **Destination approach assistance stops the truck on the street chain
      (FIXED 2026-08-22).** Owner, Spokane, 2026-08-21: "destination
      assistance did not automatically stop at the destination; I had to
      stop." Third report of that sentence (Odessa 2026-08-19 before it).
      Measured on a real facility street chain with the keeper holding: the
      truck crossed the arrival point at 13.8 mph.

      THE ROOT CAUSE WAS FRAME ORDER, not the model. `_update_destination_
      approach_assist` ran AFTER `t.update(dt)` in `DrivingUpdateMixin.update`,
      so the brake it set was never integrated: the keyboard brake ramp at the
      top of the next frame decayed it to ~0 before the physics ran. A bench
      that recorded the pedals at the physics call showed `brk=0.00` the whole
      way to the gate while the assist's own state said 0.40. Every earlier fix
      to this assist (v1 finished-only, v2 same-city gate, v3 remaining_miles,
      and the 2026-08-19 ramp fix) tuned a number against a pedal the truck
      never felt; the ramp case only "worked" because a 45 mph arrival is so
      far over the curve that even the decayed remnant did something. It now
      runs with the other assists' pedal floors, ahead of the physics.

      Three more things landed with it, each measured:
        * The arrival is LATCHED once it begins; it no longer re-decides each
          frame against its own curve and hand the pedals back under it.
        * It brakes on the stop profile itself from the latch, via a new
          floorless `arrival_servo_brake` -- a gate is not a bar; stopping
          short of a gate that opens AT the point is the failure.
        * The zone keeper refuses to re-engage while an arrival is active
          (`_destination_arrival_active`), the way it already refuses on a
          ramp; before, every zone on the chain handed it back and it held the
          street limit against the shed.
        * It speaks "Destination approach assistance slowing." (ROUTE /
          CONFIRMATION) when it takes the pedals. Its only line used to fire
          after the truck was stopped.

      Driven by the owner the next morning (Spokane again, 2026-08-22) and
      two more fell out, both fixed the same session:
        * The RAMP branch treated the ramp's end as the gate even when a
          street chain follows -- which the decayed pedal had hidden. Now
          the brake works it stopped the truck dead at the bottom of the ramp
          with a mile of city to go, speed control paused the arrival way for
          all of it. `_destination_street_chain_ahead()` (memoised) gates the
          ramp branch off; the chain's own trip carries the arrival.
        * `_update_exit_speed_assist` paused speed control on reach, not on
          need. Right for the flat 45 (every truck at road speed was over
          it); wrong once the gore accepts road speed -- it paused cruise,
          did nothing, and the truck ran 60 to 69 down a 3.7 percent grade
          with "paused" the only status. It now leaves a holding controller
          alone until the truck is over what the gore accepts.

      Third Spokane drive (2026-08-22), the ramp handoff itself: the chain
      starts 264 ft before a right onto West Main Avenue. Its approach call
      was raised a frame after the swap as a droppable ambient lead, queued
      behind the ROUTE off-the-ramp line and the gate warning, went stale and
      was dropped -- twice, the second time after the loop-back (whose
      reposition floors at the chain start, closer than one spoken window).
      Speed control was still under the ramp's transit pause and the owner
      was on the brake, which is the one condition that keeps the keeper from
      resuming. Fixed three ways: `_begin_surface_chain` folds the first
      corner into its own ROUTE line when the chain starts inside the corner's
      window (marks it advised, sets `controlled_turn`, plays the panned
      earcon); a "now" approach call (`TURN_NOW_MI`) is ROUTE, never a lead;
      and the transit pause is cleared at the handoff so the street zones
      re-engage the keeper on the first frame.

      Known rough edge, recorded rather than tuned: the tracker maps needed
      deceleration onto the pedal through `assist_full_decel_mps2` and lags a
      rising demand, so the last few metres on a downgrade street finish at a
      firm application. It stops within a truck length of the point (pinned by
      `test_the_approach_assist_stops_within_a_truck_length_of_the_gate`), but a
      grade feed-forward would make the finish gentler.

- [x] **The DEPARTURE chain does not carry the arrival's clock fault, but the
      acceleration lane after it does (MEASURED and FIXED 2026-08-24).** The
      question the entry below leaves open: `begin_departure_chain` sets no
      `dock_run_in`, so the streets a truck drives LEAVING a facility still
      run compressed. Swept the same way -- twenty-five chain-capable
      facilities, one per state, fixed order, seeded trip and pinned weather,
      the driver holding the game's own advised number for the corner in play.

      VERDICT on the streets: clean, and no pin is wanted. `controlled_turn`
      already holds the clock at real time from the moment a corner enters its
      own window until it resolves, and that window is itself sized in real
      seconds (`TURN_WARNING_REAL_S`), so a corner's run-up is never
      compressed. Measured: 0 to 13 feet of compressed ground in the last
      tenth of a mile before an unjudged corner, per departure, against a
      truck 70 feet long -- and all of that is the frame or two between one
      corner resolving and the next latching. Driving the same twenty-five
      with the whole clock pinned to real time changes the outcome of 2
      corners in 125. The ARRIVAL chain, which IS pinned, scores the same on
      every corner measure (125 corners each: 74 vs 74 come in under a third
      of the design lead, 91 vs 90 are not cleanly taken), which is what says
      the remaining corner difficulty is the shipped street geometry --
      corners 260 feet apart with a 20 mph advisory -- and not the clock.
      Copying the arrival's flag here would have been copying the flag that
      exists rather than the fault that exists.

      RECORDED, not fixed, and not the clock: a departure loses more corners
      to the miss loop than an arrival does -- 16 of 125 against 5 -- because
      an arrival has the approach assist shedding speed over its last stretch
      and a departure is driven the whole way, which is the design. Pinning
      the clock to real time moves that 16 to 14. What is left is the
      commitment loop meeting a downtown grid: a corner advised at 20 with the
      next one 260 feet on, and a loaded truck that has to be under it. Worth
      a look as a turn-machinery question, not as a clock one.

      No stop signs, lights or yields exist on a chain to price wrongly:
      `Leg::local` carries no stops, so `place_stops` puts none on either
      direction's chain. Every zone and exit warning already converts through
      `effective_time_scale`.

      TWO REAL DEFECTS the sweep did find, both fixed here.

      1. The acceleration lane out of the streets IS priced in real feet and
         spent by compressed ground. `finish_departure_chain` sizes it from
         AASHTO Green Book Table 10-3 and `update_departure_ramp` decrements
         it by `moved_mi`, which carries the scale, so the truck built speed
         in real seconds while the lane ran out about seven times too fast.
         Measured before: Abilene's 1790 feet went by in 12.8 real seconds
         where a truck merely holding the 27 mph it reached needs 45.2; tapers
         came out at 14 to 28 mph, median 27 under the road, twenty-three of
         twenty-five more than 10 under. Fix: `controlled_ramp` now covers
         the departure lane as well as the exit ramp -- the same law, the
         other direction --
         and set in `finish_departure_chain` so not even the handoff frame is
         compressed. After: tapers 34 to 56 mph, median 5 under, nine still
         more than 10 under, and those are a loaded truck on a short ramp,
         which `update_departure_ramp`'s own line already treats as normal.
      2. The destination approach assist fired on EVERY chain departure, all
         twenty-five. `update_destination_approach_assist` measured off
         `is_facility_approach_route()`, which cannot tell the origin's
         streets from the destination's -- they are the same streets -- so it
         read the on-ramp as the dock, said "Destination approach assistance
         slowing" with the delivery a whole run away, and took the pedals for
         the merge -- three to four mph off the taper even with the lane
         itself pinned, and the spoken line untrue at all twenty-five. Fix:
         it now also requires `!trip.outbound`, which is the trip's own word
         for which end of a facility's streets the gate is at.

      Pinned by `crates/freight-fate/tests/it/states_driving_departure_sweep.rs`:
      the lane is not outrun by its own length and its closing line quotes the
      truck's real speed; the arrival assist never takes the pedals leaving a
      yard; and the verdict itself -- a corner's run-up is never covered at
      compressed pace -- asserted against the mechanism rather than a flag, so
      it fires whether the turn latch or the real-second window is what goes.
      Verified to fail without each fix (25 of 25 in every case). The file
      also keeps the arrival-side control and the pacing A/B as probes, which
      is the evidence for the verdict.

- [x] **The facility street chain runs on the real clock, which is what the
      approach assist was missing (FIXED 2026-08-24).** Owner, 2026-08-24:
      "destination approach assistance works on some legs and not others."
      The split was the destination's own shape, not the leg: measured over
      fifty facilities in fifty states, every PLAIN facility (ramp ends at the
      gate) docked at a crawl, while every one with a turn-level STREET CHAIN
      crossed its own gate at 2 to 20.5 mph, median 9.7, two of them over the
      gate's posted 15.

      Cause. Time compression does not speed the clock up, it moves the truck
      further per second (`position_mi += velocity * dt * scale`). The arrival
      assist prices its shed in real metres and real seconds, which is exactly
      right on the destination ramp -- `trip.dock_run_in` pins that to real
      time -- and hopelessly optimistic on a chain, which had no such pin: the
      ground closed four to seven times faster than the brakes could answer
      for, and worse, the scale SNAPPED from 1 back to about 7 the instant a
      corner released (`controlled_turn` was the chain's only decompression,
      the 2026-08-21 entry below), eating the last two hundred metres of an
      Asheville approach in a couple of seconds with the servo mid-shed.

      Fix: `dock_run_in` now covers the surface chain as well as the ramp, and
      `begin_surface_chain` sets it on the chain trip so not even the swap
      frame runs compressed. The assist itself is untouched -- its curve was
      never wrong, the road under it was. After: all fifty reach the gate at
      the designed 2.0 mph walk and stop on it, 0 ft past.

      Pinned by `crates/freight-fate/tests/it/states_driving_approach_sweep.rs`
      (the fifty-destination sweep, seeded trip and pinned weather so the draw
      cannot choose the case), which also discharges the four
      `states_driving_facility.rs` approach-assist cases deferred on "a
      hands-off end-to-end drive over baked chain data".

      Recorded, not fixed: street chains carry no grade data at all -- they
      are laid on local street geometry, which has no grade segments -- so
      every chain in the world reads dead level. The uphill-gate case bakes
      its own grade for that reason.

- [x] **Street corners buy real seconds even when they have nothing to advise
      (FIXED 2026-08-21).** Owner's Spokane arrival fired four turn cues in
      fifteen real seconds -- 23:26:22, :25, :27, :35, the last two seconds
      before the truck stopped. Cause: `_update_turn_commitment` early-returns
      when the truck is already at or under the corner's advised speed, and
      that return was the ONLY path that never set `trip.controlled_turn`.
      The keeper was holding 14-15 through the facility zones, under every
      corner, so the whole chain ran at full compression. `controlled_turn`
      is what pins `effective_time_scale` to 1.0, so the miles between
      corners were passing in a tenth of the real time they should have.
      The advisory still stays quiet for a crawling truck; the clock no
      longer does.

- [ ] **Corner speed from real geometry, not a clamp (researched 2026-08-21,
      owner asked for real numbers).** Today `_turn_speed_mph` is the street's
      posted limit clamped between `FACILITY_GATE_LIMIT_MPH` (15) and
      `TURN_CORNER_MAX_MPH` (20). Both ends are assumed constants with no
      cited basis, and the 15 floor is why the assist stayed SILENT on the
      owner's Spokane arrival: `_update_turn_commitment` skips the whole
      advisory when the truck is already at or below the corner speed, and
      the keeper was holding 14-15 through the facility zones.

      DATA WE ALREADY HAVE AND THROW AWAY: `tools/build_local_geometry.py`
      `turn_direction()` computes the signed heading change through every
      junction and keeps only its SIGN. The magnitude is the corner's real
      turn angle, derived from read OSM geometry, and baking it is a small
      change to a builder that already runs.

      DATA GATHERED (all free, all citable):

        * **TxDOT Roadway Design Manual Table 13-7** -- WB-67 minimum simple
          curve radius BY TURN ANGLE: 60 deg 200 ft, 75 deg 145, 90 deg 125,
          105 deg 115, 120 deg 105. Radius as a function of the one thing the
          bake can measure, for our own design vehicle.
        * **AASHTO WB-67 centreline turning radius 41 ft** (Green Book
          p. 2-77) -- the vehicle's own minimum path, distinct from the
          intersection's edge curve above.
        * **AASHTO side friction by design speed** -- already in the repo,
          `data/curves.py AASHTO_SIDE_FRICTION`, but it stops at 20 mph
          (0.27). Cross-checks against TxDOT Table 4-4, whose 20 mph normal
          crown minimum radius of 99 ft implies e+f = 400/(15*99) = 0.269.
        * **Static rollover threshold >= 0.35 g** is the satisfactory
          criterion for a loaded combination (NHTSA DOT HS 811 734; FHWA
          vehicle characteristics study). Rearward amplification is about 1.0
          for a tractor-semitrailer, so the trailer does not amplify it.
        * **Measured turn speeds** -- TTI 0-4365-4 "Turn Speeds and Crashes
          Within Right-Turn Lanes": 85th percentile mid-turn speed 13 to
          21 mph over corner radii of 27 to 86 ft, free-flow. A calibration
          target, and mostly passenger cars, so a loaded truck belongs at or
          under the bottom of that band.

      THE OPEN DECISION, and why this is not landed yet: which radius
      governs. `V = sqrt(15 R (e+f))` with e = 0 at an at-grade intersection
      gives 22-24 mph off TxDOT's 125 ft edge curve for a 90 deg turn --
      FASTER than today's clamp, and plainly wrong for a loaded semi. Off the
      vehicle's own 41 ft path it gives about 10 mph at 0.15 g, which matches
      CDL practice (5-10 mph through a corner) and the bottom of the TTI
      band. The edge curve is what the swept path uses; the vehicle radius is
      what the tractor tracks. Picking one, or the smaller of the two, is a
      real modelling choice and wants deciding on purpose rather than by
      whichever makes the number look right -- which AGENTS.md forbids.

      Whatever lands: the 15 mph FLOOR has to go, or the advisory stays
      silent at exactly the speeds that need it.

- [x] **T plans the next sleep stop at any distance (FIXED 2026-08-22).**
      The planner's candidate filter was bounded by `_exit_window_mi()` -- the
      exit-SIGNAL window, five-odd miles sized in real seconds -- so T seven
      miles short of Hanging Lake declined and worked a minute later (owner).
      Candidates are now every sleep-capable stop ahead on the route, nearest
      first; `_speak_selected_sleep_stop` says "press X" inside the window and
      "you will be told when its exit comes up; press X then" beyond it,
      since X does nothing out there yet. The plan persists in
      `trip.planned_stop_key` exactly as before; nothing arms until X.

- [ ] **Two riders from the New Haven log, one still open.**
      1. [x] FIXED 2026-08-22: the status readout (S) and `status_lines()`
         now speak what the keeper is HOLDING -- `_keeper_ease_target`'s
         number with its reason -- and the set speed only when it differs:
         "speed keeper holding 15 miles per hour for the corner, set 25".
         Owner hit it on the Spokane street chain the same day.
      2. "Posted limit lower; speed keeper easing to 15" is CONFIRMATION and
         so is an earcon at quiet. An unrequested 10 mph speed change is
         exactly what the owner's own quiet rule says must be spoken.

- [ ] **Facility approach speeds have no provenance field.** The segments in
      `facility_approaches.json` carry `speed_mph` with no way to tell a read
      OSM `maxspeed` from the bake's class default, which is why the runtime
      had to stop trusting all of them at once. A re-bake should write
      `speed_source` (read/assumed) per segment, and report the assumed ratio
      in the layer's `meta` -- today it would read about 13,209 of 13,210.

- [x] **Real street limits for the approach: OSM cannot supply them, the
      state vehicle code can, and now does (SHIPPED 2026-08-21).** Owner asked (2026-08-21) whether facility
      approaches and city streets have real posted limits we could use
      instead of the baked 25/15. Measured against the cached extracts, over
      the road classes an approach chain is actually built from:

      | state | `service` tagged | `residential` tagged |
      |---|---|---|
      | South Dakota | 0.2% (176 of 97,723) | 1.9% |
      | Ohio | 0.5% (5,437 of 1,119,405) | 14.0% |
      | California | 1.3% | 5.7% |
      | New York | 1.0% | 11.1% |

      Arterials are a different story (`primary` runs 48-65% tagged), which
      is why the corridor maxspeed bake worked. But the yard and driveway
      class is 1% or less EVERYWHERE, so "read the posted limit" is not
      available for the last mile at any coverage worth having. Reproduce
      with the handler in this item's commit message.

      What IS readable is the law that governs an unposted street: every
      state's vehicle code sets a statutory limit for business and residence
      districts that applies with no sign present (e.g. Virginia Code
      46.2-874 sets 25). That is a READ value from a published legal source,
      per-state, and it is what a real driver is actually held to on these
      streets. It would replace the blanket 25 with the state's own number
      and give the spoken limit a citation, the way `tools/toll_rates.py`
      does. The yard's own internal road is not covered by the vehicle code
      at all -- a private facility posts its own 5 to 15 -- so the gate's 15
      stays an assumption and should be labeled one.

      BUILT, and no re-bake was needed: the limit is a per-state constant and
      the runtime already knows the state, so it is a 49-row file read at
      load (`tools/statutory_limits.py` curates it with citations,
      `data/street_limits.py` loads it). 45 of 49 jurisdictions verified
      against primary sources; 3,919 of 5,037 facilities (78 percent) now
      drive a cited statutory number instead of the blanket 25.

      FOUR THINGS THE RESEARCH FOUND THAT THE DESIGN HAD TO ABSORB, all of
      them cases where reading the number off the page would have been wrong:

      1. SOME STATES WRITE NO STREET DEFAULT AT ALL. Connecticut, Louisiana,
         Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New York, Oklahoma, Tennessee and
         Vermont have no business/residence/urban category; their statutory
         answer for an unsigned city street is the statewide ceiling, 50 to
         80 mph. A row can now declare `no_district_default` so "checked,
         there is none" reads differently from a row nobody filled in, and
         the parser refuses any OTHER empty row.
      2. A LIMIT CAN EXIST AND STILL NOT APPLY UNPOSTED. Pennsylvania writes
         35 urban and 25 residence, then 75 Pa.C.S. 3362(b)(1) makes both
         ineffective without signs at each end of the zone and every half
         mile. `signs_required` now discards the row: real in the statute,
         false on the road.
      3. NATIONAL SUMMARY TABLES ARE WRONG. Secondary sources report Illinois
         at 20 mph urban effective October 2025; the bill stalled and the
         ILGA text still reads 30. This is why the research prompt forbade
         summary tables and required the code section itself.
      4. THE INVERSIONS ARE REAL. Colorado posts residence 30 ABOVE business
         25; Iowa, Nebraska and Oregon put business BELOW residence. Nothing
         here can be collapsed to one number per state.

      Georgia, Mississippi, New Mexico and Tennessee stay on the fallback:
      their official codes are LexisNexis-published and render nothing to a
      fetcher, so the figures exist only from secondary sources. Anyone with
      Lexis access can verify those four and flip `verified` -- that is the
      whole change.

- [x] **The gate's 15 is an assumption, and is now labeled as one
      (2026-08-21).** No vehicle code reaches inside a private facility -- a
      yard's road is the owner's to sign, and real distribution centers post
      anywhere from 5 to 15 -- so there is no citation to be had and none was
      invented. Closed by labeling rather than by research: the constant in
      `sim/trip_models.py` now says it is the game's own number and why,
      which matters more than usual now that it sits directly beside the
      cited statutory street limits. Chasing an OSHA or insurance guideline
      would have produced another assumption wearing a better hat, which is
      exactly what the provenance rule forbids.

- [x] **Bake-time provenance and sanity rules -- the substrate for three
      separate data bugs found on 2026-08-17/18. RULE SHIPPED 2026-08-18.**
      Owner wanted a rule about verifying OSM before baking. The provenance
      audit says the rule has to be wider than that, because only one of the
      three bugs is an OSM problem at all.

      WHERE EVERY LAYER ACTUALLY COMES FROM, counted off the baked `source`
      fields: ORS supplies exactly ONE thing, grade_segments, all 146,496 of
      them, from its route elevation profile. OSM/Overpass supplies the tag
      layers -- interchanges 18,011, lane_segments 20,666, speed_limits
      14,563 of 15,234, restrictions 259, most stops. Neither supplies
      state_crossings (OSRM geometry plus public boundary GeoJSON) nor tolls
      (hand-researched per authority, `tools/toll_rates.py`).

      THREE FAILURE MODES, THREE DIFFERENT RULES.
      1. ORS elevation is noisy and was trusted per segment: 455 grades over
         8 percent, +14.4 on I-5, on 0.2-0.3 mile spans that are bridges.
         This is the only one where "check it against an official source"
         literally applies -- FHWA publishes the interstate grade ceiling.
      2. OSM is THIN, not wrong. `maxspeed` is simply absent outside the
         14,563 segments that carry it; `ramp_control` was absent on all
         18,011 exits; facility approach speeds fall back to "25 named / 15
         unnamed" and the baked data holds exactly two values across 9,588
         legs, which is the fallback doing all the work. OSM never asserted
         anything false. We filled its silence with defaults and baked them
         looking identical to readings. Verification cannot help here; only
         refusing to let a fallback look like a reading can.
      3. OUR OWN ARITHMETIC, with fine inputs: curve radius/deflection
         computed from sparse geometry (the script derives these, OSM does
         not supply them), and the gate zone that was longer than a quarter
         of the roads it sat on. No amount of source verification touches
         these.

      SHIPPED: the rule is in `CLAUDE.md` under "Provenance: read, derived,
      or assumed -- never blurred". Every baked value declares its kind, a
      builder must announce when a layer comes back mostly assumed, a derived
      value is screened against the physical limit for its class before it is
      written, and the official sources that do exist are named there (state
      DOT design manuals, FHWA HPMS, USGS 3DEP, FHWA NBI, 23 CFR 658
      Appendix A). The contributor guide moved from `AGENTS.md` into
      `CLAUDE.md` in the same change, at the owner's request.

- [ ] **The world baked before that rule still does not declare its kinds.**
      Tagging the existing layers is its own sweep, and so is making the
      builders refuse to finish quietly. MEASURED: `ramp_control` empty on
      18,011 of 18,011; `speed_limits` unsourced on 671 of 15,234;
      `landmarks` unsourced on 4,489 of 31,384; `route_points` (7,646),
      `state_miles` (1,750), `legs` (1,290) and `route_via` (27) carry no
      `source` at all. `grade_segments`, `lane_segments`, `interchanges`,
      `stops`, `checkpoints`, `state_crossings`, `restrictions` and
      `toll_events` are fully sourced -- but "sourced" is what the 146,496
      grade segments carrying impossible slopes were too, which is the point.

- [x] **Grade data carried impossible slopes, same shape as the curve
      artifacts (audit 2026-08-18, screened 2026-08-18).** 455 of 146,496
      grade segments were steeper than 8 percent, topping out at **+14.4
      percent on I-5**, and 1,077 interstate segments exceeded the 6 percent
      design ceiling for the class. The tell was self-contradiction, not
      steepness: 336 of the 455 were labelled `flat` or `hills` rather than
      `mountain`, and 335 ran only 0.2 or 0.3 miles -- the signature of
      elevation-profile sampling over a bridge deck, not of road.

      SHIPPED as a load-time screen in `src/freight_fate/data/grades.py`,
      wired into `world_corridor.build_leg_corridor`. It could NOT copy the
      curve screen's mountain exemption: the worst record, the I-5 14.4, is
      itself labelled `mountain`. Road class carries the harder fact instead
      -- no interstate is built past 7 -- so the ceiling is the stricter of
      class (interstate 7, US 10, state 12) and the bake's own terrain label
      (flat 6, hills 8). 926 segments, 0.63 percent, are capped; US-550,
      CA-299 and the Eisenhower approach are untouched.

      It CLAMPS where the curve screen DROPS, because grades tile the leg
      continuously and `Trip.grade_at` falls through to a synthesized terrain
      average for any uncovered mile -- dropping a spike out of a real climb
      would swap a noisy reading for an invented one. The bake is untouched;
      a capped segment records the derivation in its own `source`.

      STILL OPEN, the deeper fix: the noise is bridges and overpasses in a
      30 m SRTM profile. FHWA's National Bridge Inventory gives every US
      bridge's location and length, which is exactly the mask to drop those
      samples against, and USGS 3DEP at 1/3 arc-second is a finer elevation
      surface than the one ORS sampled. A re-bake against those would remove
      the artifacts rather than cap them.

- [ ] **Ramp ends are too often stop signs (owner, 2026-08-17: "fix ramps to
      be more realistic, e.g. no stop signs at the end of ramps"). MOSTLY
      SHIPPED.** The measurement this bullet used to open with -- "all 18,011
      exits carry an empty `ramp_control`, OpenStreetMap tagged a control on
      none of them" -- WAS WRONG, and wrong in the way that mattered. The
      ramp-control bake had only ever been run over Indiana and Ohio; the
      cached index at `~/.cache/freight-fate-osm/regions/freight-fate-rampcontrols.json`
      covers exactly two state extracts and holds 161 nodes. Nobody had asked
      OSM nationally.

      DONE (2026-08-18): the 4,999 exits whose `via` names an interstate are
      decided free-flow before the dice are rolled -- a stop sign where two
      freeways meet does not exist. Then the ramp-control bake was run over
      all 49 state extracts: **8,205 of 18,011 exits (45.6 percent) now carry
      a control read from OSM** -- 5,629 signal, 2,576 stop -- across 712 of
      754 legs.

      WHAT THE REAL DATA SAYS ABOUT THE OLD GUESS: among tagged terminals the
      split is 69 percent signal / 31 percent stop. `RAMP_CONTROL_RURAL_WEIGHTS
      = (0.30, 0.80)` reads as 30 signal / 50 stop / 20 free-flow. The
      heuristic was far more stop-heavy than the road is, which is exactly
      what the owner heard. Treat the 69/31 as suggestive rather than a
      target: OSM tags signals more diligently than stop signs, and tagged
      terminals skew urban.

      STILL OPEN, 9,806 exits: OSM says nothing about them and the dice still
      decide. Two ways to close it -- retune the weights against the measured
      split, or bake the interchange TYPE from OSM junction geometry so the
      control follows the road. The second is the honest one and is the
      chosen direction.

- [ ] **The speed keeper announces a number it then fails to hold -- NOT
      REPRODUCED, mechanism unknown (owner report, 2026-08-17).** "Speed
      keeper holding 25 through the facility access road zone" while the
      truck sits near 14. **This bullet previously asserted a mechanism and
      that assertion was wrong; it is corrected here rather than left to
      mislead.**

      THREE HYPOTHESES WERE TESTED AND ALL THREE DISPROVEN. (1) The throttle
      law: replacing the bare integrator with PI plus anti-windup changed the
      outcome not at all, and was reverted. (2) The box leaving the truck
      lugging in too tall a gear: at the settle point throttle was already at
      the cap, so the loop was demanding everything available. (3)
      `_take_new_posted_limit` announcing the raised number in the present
      tense: on the real loop the truck reaches the new number in about ten
      seconds and holds it.

      EVERY BENCH REPRODUCTION WAS AN ARTIFACT, four of them, each producing
      a confident wrong answer. `_update_keeper` CANNOT be driven in
      isolation: it needs a real `Zone` under the wheels (without one it
      cancels on tick one and hands to cruise), a gear engaged,
      `transmission.automatic`, `truck.auto_shift()` every frame (**the
      driving loop runs the box, `TruckState.update` does not**), and the
      loop's per-frame brake ramp-down (`driving_updates.py` line 349 --
      without it the snub brake latches at 0.20 forever and the truck decays
      to 11 mph, which is what the wrong mechanism above was built on).
      `tests/playtest_harness.py` also hand-rolls its frame and overrides
      throttle; the only faithful driver is `driving.update(dt)` itself.

      WHAT THE REAL LOOP ACTUALLY DOES, measured: press K at 14 mph on a
      15-limit service way and it says "holding 14", honestly. Crossing into
      a 25 zone it raises to 25 and the truck is doing 24.7 within ten
      seconds. Correct behaviour throughout.

      THE ONE LIVE THREAD: when the keeper raised itself from 14 to 25,
      NOTHING was spoken -- though `_take_new_posted_limit` ends in a
      `say_event` and its own comment says an assist that speeds the truck up
      on its own has to say so. If that line fires on the owner's machine and
      not on the bench, the difference is the lead.

      NEXT STEP IS EVIDENCE, NOT ANOTHER HYPOTHESIS: a
      `FREIGHT_FATE_LOG_FILE` capture from a drive where the owner actually
      sees it, giving the spoken line, the real speed, the gear, and the zone
      under the wheels at that moment. Four synthetic guesses at those is
      what produced four wrong answers.

- [ ] **K in a low-speed zone with the speed keeper turned off speaks a
      dead end.** "Adaptive cruise is not available in a facility access
      road zone" never says the keeper exists, is off, or where to turn it
      on (Settings, Gameplay, Controls) -- it cost the owner a settings
      hunt on 2026-08-14. The line should name the setting.
- [x] **Three tester follow-ups from Darren's 2026-08-14 report -- landed.**
      The scale gets its own warning earcon -- a procedural low thump-then-
      beep, `events/weigh_station_warning` -- instead of sharing the
      inspection cue, so the open-scale notice is unmistakable before a
      word is spoken. A highway narrowing to one lane now says so whenever
      the lane-count clamp actually moves you, not only when a construction
      closure does; already in the surviving lane, it stays silent. And the
      roadside tableau -- the siren and shoulder pass for a trooper working
      somebody else -- now reliably says "not you" the moment the siren
      starts, with a seeded pinch of why (speeding, a log check, a light
      out) on some occurrences and the bare fact in terse mode.
- [x] **Second round of Dropbox tester findings -- landed 2026-08-12.**
      Passing now has a way back: a one-shot "Clear of the box truck.
      Right lane open." spoken from the same occupancy check that decides
      a sideswipe, plus an L readout of every neighbouring lane on demand
      (Darren). Driver name entry grew a real caret -- arrows review and
      speak each character, editing happens at the caret (Cary). The
      low-air warning got hysteresis so brake-heavy driving warns once
      per episode, not per dip (Darren). Traffic stops settle the engine
      sound to idle, and motel sleep shuts the engine off before the wake
      prompt asks you to restart it (Jerry, Darren). The speed keeper's
      corner hold no longer hides the next corner of a short city block
      (Shane's "turns coming up really quickly"). Live weather holds
      last-known conditions through a stale station instead of dropping
      to neutral, without traceback spam in the log.
- [x] **Resuming cruise to a high target eases up instead of flooring the
      engine -- landed 2026-08-12** (Shane's redline scream on a 12 percent
      grade). Adaptive/automatic cruise was pure proportional control: a set
      speed far above the current one commanded wide-open throttle at once.
      On the flat the governor capped it; on a downgrade it over-revved past
      redline during the automatic box's between-shift hold and charged
      engine wear. Cruise now chases a working setpoint that ramps toward the
      target at a bounded rate (CRUISE_ACCEL_MPH_PER_S), tapers its throttle
      to nothing as coupled RPM nears the governor (CRUISE_RPM_CEILING_BAND,
      so descent control and the retarder own the grade and cruise never
      feeds an over-rev), and the open-road resume waits for CRUISE_MIN_MPH
      before engaging -- the same bridge the zone-preceded automatic resume
      already gave. tests/test_cruise_resume_ramp.py pins the ramp, the RPM
      ceiling, the engage gate, and the no-redline invariant at road speed.
      Follow-up (not this fix): coasting an unbraked steep grade up from a
      near standstill still over-revs on gravity alone through the gears --
      descent-control territory, tracked separately.
- [x] **The scale announcement and the T key tell the same story --
      landed 2026-08-12** (Jerry's bypass pull-over). The open-scale
      call taught "press T", but T at speed plans a sleep stop, so the
      game planned a travel center past the scale, X armed that exit,
      and following both instructions crossed the scale unarmed into
      the cop. The notice now teaches the exit key first and the rest
      key only once stopped; T near an open scale defers to the scale;
      X prefers the nearer open scale over a planned sleep stop; a
      half-mile reminder fires if the truck is still over fifteen; a
      beginning pull-over stands any armed exit down (one demand at a
      time); and the stop-menu lookup picks the nearest stop, not the
      first listed, so T at the scale opens the scale's menu. Breaker
      scenarios scale_check_in_guidance and
      scale_pull_over_stands_down_exit pin the whole flow.
- [x] **Announcements cut off mid-sentence come back -- landed
      2026-08-12** (the mechanism behind Jerry's blown weigh station).
      An interrupting event line or an info-key reply on a shared voice
      purged whatever the event channel was still speaking; a ROUTE or
      CRITICAL line (scale notice, planned stop, HOS countdown, drowsy
      warning) died silently mid-word. The pacer now hands the cut line
      back and it requeues once, right behind the line that cut it, in
      all three voice configurations; the drowsy warning and non-urgent
      HOS countdowns ride ROUTE so they qualify.
- [x] **Speech-priority redesign, stage S1 -- landed 2026-08-12** (scoped
      by docs/speech-priority-research.md; R1, R2, R13). Delivery
      contracts per priority class: CRITICAL narrows to act-now (the
      hazard call), zone entries, checkpoints, and zone-ahead/traffic
      warnings ride ROUTE's never-dropped queue instead of interrupting
      -- shipped together with the coupled invariant that the
      accelerator-held grace collapse waits out the announcement's
      speech latency. Money lines (toll charged, fines, citations, the
      fuel-rescue bill) ride ROUTE so a busy stretch can never age a
      cost out of the queue; stale AMBIENT chatter drops silently to
      the message log instead of being promoted to an interrupt. The
      main channel queues instead of cutting while the driving state is
      on top (menus keep immediate speech). New Settings > Audio option,
      off by default (owner call, 2026-08-12: the engine is the
      instrument panel): engine, weather, and the radio duck to half
      volume while the event voice speaks, restored on the pacer's own
      clear-time projection. Later stages (naming diet, earcon pairs)
      remain open below.
- [x] **Speech-priority redesign, stage S2 -- landed 2026-08-12** (R4, R5,
      R8, R15). Verbosity moved into the delivery layer: a message is one
      SpokenMessage definition carrying normal and terse renderings side
      by side (`speech_text.py`), and say/say_event pick by the player's
      speech mode -- terse coverage is now a property of the message, not
      of 79 hand-built call-site branches. The terse contract's named
      categories converted under its two bounding rules (compress words,
      never certainty; fixed slot grammar, recorded in docs/ontology.md):
      hazard calls, traffic coaching, the curve-plus-cruise composite,
      stop callouts with all five parking-certainty values distinguishable,
      achievements to earcon-plus-name, tolls (heads-up drops, charged
      line always speaks), the speed-limit nag, and dodge confirmations to
      the hazard-clear earcon alone. The terse hazard synonym is fixed --
      "Brake or change lanes!" in every mode, pinned against the help by
      copy tests (tests/test_terse_contract.py) with a src-wide scan so
      the synonym cannot return. First-run guidance now ignores verbosity
      until the walkthrough completes (gated on tutorial_done itself).
      The long tail of messages that read the same in both modes stays
      normal-only by design.
- [x] **Info keys: R answers with a real distance, U stops reciting the
      other keys (owner report, 2026-08-15).** R rounded to whole miles, so
      the last half mile onto a facility gate answered "0 miles to the
      gate" for over a minute of surface-street driving; it now closes in
      quarter miles and then in feet or metres. The same report's "does not
      reflect the actual state of things" was three more frames: the street
      chain now names the street under the wheels rather than the chain's
      first leg, the departure chain out of the origin gate counts down to
      its on-ramp instead of reading a two-mile chain's percent as the
      run's progress and pointing "toward" the city the truck is standing
      in, and the pickup drive answers as the streets it is instead of a
      highway leg. U dropped the enforcement clause (owner ruling: that
      belongs on the CB), the next listed exit (Shift+R is that key),
      traffic pressure (it restated the taper or the stop beside it), and
      two of its three bends; it is capped at four clauses.
- [x] **Drive-time chattiness: even terse was far too much (owner,
      2026-08-15) -- landed 2026-08-16.** The terse contract only
      compressed each message; a quiet drive still talked constantly
      because compression never reduced the NUMBER of things spoken.
      Shipped from the four accessibility-practice principles the
      original design only half-applied: principle (2), the
      screen-reader verbosity model -- driving speech is now a
      four-rung ladder (coaching / standard / quiet / urgent only,
      `Settings.driving_speech`) that cuts whole categories of
      information rather than shortening all of them alike, tagged
      across all 164 driving speech call sites, with a tutorial
      exemption so a new driver's first-run teaching is never silenced
      by their chosen rung; and principle (4), announce on change --
      standing conditions (load damage, an engine held at redline, the
      parking brake locked out) speak once and then again only when
      what they say actually changes, via `say_event`'s `key=`, instead
      of repeating on a timer. Whole-drive proof:
      `tests/test_driving_speech_ladder.py::
      test_a_drive_gets_quieter_as_the_rung_tightens` drives a real
      scenario through all four rungs and pins the spoken line count
      falling as the rung tightens.
- [x] **The ladder's earcons actually play now -- landed 2026-08-16
      (task 10).** `LADDER_EARCONS` was wired only into the Learn game
      sounds screen's preview; the gate at `app.py` silenced a cut
      category, logged it, and returned, so Quiet and Urgent only were
      audibly identical -- a category the ladder cut was silence, never a
      sound, at every rung that cut it. `GameContext._play_ladder_earcon`
      now plays `LADDER_EARCONS[category]` (resolved through
      `sound_catalog.entry_by_name`, so the recipe lives in one place)
      wherever the rung's disposition is EARCON, in both `say` and
      `say_event`; SILENT still stays silent, which is now the entire
      difference between Quiet and Urgent only at the voice.
- [ ] **Sonification pass (principle 1 of the drive-time chattiness
      redesign above).** Convert spoken state updates (speed drift,
- [x] **One fact per key: Alt 1 to Alt 4 (Tim K., 2026-08-16).** R answers
      state, road, town and direction in one sentence, so hearing the one
      you wanted meant sitting through the other three at speed. Alt 1
      speaks the state, Alt 2 the road signed the way it reads, Alt 3 the
      town the truck is in -- or the nearest one, ranked by true distance
      rather than distance along the road, with how far off it sits -- and
      Alt 4 the direction of travel. Keypad numbers are equivalent. Alt
      with a number used to fall through to the engine-brake stages, so
      asking for the state changed the jake; the stage branch now requires
      Alt to be absent.
- [x] **The pad could not stop the event voice, or ask the limit (Sarah R.,
      2026-08-16).** Two gaps in the controller scheme, one of them a hole
      rather than a rough edge: `stop_event_speech` was bound only to Ctrl,
      so a controller-only driver had no way to silence an announcement and
      every one ran to the end. Every pad button was already bound, so Back
      is now context-sensitive -- it stops the voice while `event_voice_busy`
      (the same projection the audio duck restores on) and reads the
      controller help when nothing is speaking, which also stops it
      answering a driver who wants quiet with a paragraph of help. Right
      bumper plus X reads the posted limit, the pad's answer to S, in the
      slot Sarah proposed.
- [x] **Learn game sounds had no Back row (owner, 2026-08-16).** Escape
      worked and the intro said so, but every other menu in the game also
      offers a Back item -- 16 in the main menu alone -- so this screen was
      the one place a player had to have heard the intro to know the way out.
      Both screens now append it. On the category screen it runs `go_back`,
      which already stops a held demo, so the row cannot leave a cue ringing.
- [ ] **Departing straight into a hazard: work zone or merging traffic at
      mile zero (owner, 2026-08-16).** CONFIRMED, all three claims, and the
      three causes are separate. (1) No departure chain: only a facility with
      a genuine multi-segment turn-level chain gets one
      (`_departure_chain_route`); every other origin keeps the scripted
      departure straight onto the highway, so route mile 0 IS the spawn and
      there are no city miles to absorb anything. (2) Work zone at zero:
      simulated zones draw from `uniform(15, ...)` so their taper cannot
      start before mile 14, but REAL 511 zones have no such floor --
      `start_mi = max(0.0, best_leg_mile - zone_length / 2)` clamps to zero,
      so a real event near the corridor start can already cover the truck
      before it moves, with the taper behind it and nothing to announce.
      (3) Merging traffic ahead: `spawn_initial_traffic` keeps slot 0 at
      least 8 miles into a leg, but the rolling bubble's floor is
      `NO_SPAWN_AHEAD_MI = 1.1`, and a cell drawn there can roll the
      "merging" intent, so the first thing a driver hears on pulling out is
      a merge cue about a vehicle barely a mile off.
      CORRECTION to the first write-up of this bullet: the departure chain
      is NOT a fix for (2) or (3), and treating it as the honest complete
      answer was wrong. `_finish_departure_chain` hands the parked highway
      trip back unchanged and never advances its position, so the truck
      rejoins at highway mile 0 either way. A real zone clamped to zero
      still covers the merge, and the bubble still seeds around the truck at
      its 1.1-mile floor -- the chain buys a minute of streets and then
      delivers the driver into the same hazard at ramp speed.
      Measured coverage, since it sizes the data option: 3,639 of 5,054
      facilities (72 percent) depart straight onto the highway, and all 624
      cities have at least one. That is a rebuild of most approach data, not
      a gap-fill.
      SPLIT, (a) and (b) LANDED 2026-08-16 on owner go-ahead:
      (a) DONE. A real zone whose `start_mi` is inside `CONSTRUCTION_TAPER_MI`
      of the route start is dropped rather than having its taper clipped to
      nothing. Not "no hazards in the first miles" -- a zone at mile 5 signed
      from mile 4 is untouched. The game declines to place a hazard it cannot
      sign, rather than hiding work that is really there.
      (b) DONE. `MERGE_FREE_START_MI = 3.0` withholds the "merging" intent
      from the bubble inside the opening miles, keyed off the route mile so
      it also covers the on-ramp handback. Harness evidence:
      `floor_it_through_town` used to open "Merging box truck 1.5 miles
      ahead" and now opens "Slow box truck 1.5 miles ahead", with merging
      traffic still appearing later in the same run.
      (c) OPEN -- departure chains for the remaining 72 percent of
      facilities. Real and wanted, a data project to scope on its own. It is
      the realism fix, not the safety fix, and does not gate anything now
      that (a) and (b) have landed.
- [x] **The dial is inert with the radio switched off (Darren, 2026-08-16;
      owner ruling the same day).** Tuning while off used to pick a station
      silently and hold it for power-on -- deliberate, and it worked, but it
      is not how a radio behaves and it read as a station that had failed to
      play. First pass only lengthened the sentence to explain itself; the
      owner ruled for the expectation instead, which is the better call
      because matching what a driver already knows beats teaching them a
      quirk. `tune` and `tune_category` now return `_dial_is_off()` before
      touching `station_id`, and `_radio_switched_off()` in the driving layer
      ticks and speaks, deliberately the same shape as `_radio_no_power` so
      the two "not right now" answers feel like one response. It says "Radio
      off" rather than going silent -- nothing happening with no explanation
      is the one outcome a screen reader user cannot tell from a broken key.
      `select_station` is untouched: that is the game retuning off a station
      the player lost (streamer-safe, signal gone), not a dial key, and it
      has to work regardless of the switch.
- [x] **R2 caught the info keys as well as the notices (Sarah R. via the
      owner, 2026-08-16).** A 1.9 regression against 1.8, found only because
      the owner knew 1.8 muted speech on any button. On dev/main `ctx.say` is
      `speech.say(text, interrupt)` with no pacer, so every readout cut the
      line in progress. `e0230c85` (R2) added `paces_main_speech` to stop
      unasked-for lines stamping on one mid-air -- right for achievements and
      assist notices, but applied to every main-channel line at the wheel, so
      pressing a key stopped cutting too. That is the whole contract of an
      info key, and the thing a tester coming from 1.8 reaches for first.
      Fixed centrally, matching how R2 itself was done rather than tagging
      twenty call sites that gain siblings every week: `GameContext.
      player_asked()` wraps the driving state's key and pad handlers, and
      `say` exempts anything spoken inside it. Anything arriving from
      `update` still queues. The existing `_requeue_cut_event` rescue means a
      road line cut by an answer is re-delivered behind it rather than lost --
      confirmed in the probe, not assumed.
      NOTE for the record: my first reply to Sarah told her the keyboard
      never interrupted either and called the behaviour deliberate. That was
      true of 1.9's code and wrong as an answer, because she was reporting a
      CHANGE. Corrected in the living document.
- [x] **Emergency braking, pass one: two controls the pad was promised and
      never had (owner, 2026-08-16).** `emergency = keys[pygame.K_b]` was the
      only source of the emergency application, while the controller help,
      `input_hints` and the manual all said "press the left trigger fully for
      the hardest stop". A pad driver got a full service application and none
      of what the emergency one carries -- the air cue, the rumble, and every
      check keyed off `emergency_brake`. `PAD_EMERGENCY_BRAKE = 0.97` now
      arms it, gated on `not backing` because holding that same trigger from
      a stop is the reverse gesture. Worse in the same area: the microsleep
      reaction check was four keys, so a controller-only driver could not
      react to "steer or brake now" and drifted off the road every time; the
      stick and the trigger now count, at keyboard parity (a held Down arrow
      already counted).
- [ ] **PARKED BRANCH `fix/honest-brake-decel` (b2a5a43a, pushed, owner
      parked it 2026-08-16 rather than land it the night before a build).**
      Gap (a) below is DONE on that branch and measured: `max_brake_decel_g`
      0.35 -> 0.55 and `EMERGENCY_BRAKE_MULT` 1.6 -> 1.0 put a loaded rig at
      215 ft from 60 mph, and make `full_service_decel_mps2` describe the
      truck the brakes actually are. `CARGO_HARD_BRAKE_G` 0.45 -> 0.8 came
      with it (0.45 was unsourced, chosen to sit in the gap between the old
      full-service and emergency figures; 0.8 g forward is 49 CFR 393.102,
      already cited in the comment beside it). Three tests rewritten to the
      new model, not loosened.
      WHAT BLOCKS THE MERGE, and it is a decision rather than a bug: two
      assist tests fail, one of which encodes the owner ruling of 2026-08-11
      that the automatic braking assist must actually stop in time. The 1.6x
      boost was what delivered that. With the emergency application no longer
      stronger than a full pedal, a hot, worn, wet, 6-percent-downgrade stop
      at 65 loaded genuinely cannot be made in 2.5 s, and escalating buys the
      assist nothing. RECOMMENDED RESOLUTION: keep the ruling by engaging the
      assist EARLIER -- a fade margin on its budget, since in-stop fade is
      what the boost was quietly covering -- rather than letting the truck
      brake harder than physics allows. Do not rebase this onto a moved
      `feat/career-1.9` without re-running the full suite: the change moves
      every stopping distance in the game.
- [ ] **Emergency braking, realism gaps still open (measured 2026-08-16).**
      Two found while doing the above, neither a quick win, both wanted:
      (a) THE BUDGET DISAGREES WITH THE STOP. `EMERGENCY_BRAKE_MULT = 1.6`
      makes the emergency application 5.49 m/s^2 against a full service
      application's 3.43 -- 211 ft versus 334 ft from 60 mph. But
      `full_service_decel_mps2`, whose own docstring says it is "what an
      emergency-braking budget must use", returns the UNBOOSTED figure, so
      every stopping-distance cue is computed on a truck 1.6x weaker than the
      one B actually delivers. Note before changing it: 211 ft is close to
      real modern tractor-trailer performance and the FMVSS 121 reduced-
      stopping-distance ceiling of 250 ft, while 334 ft is a pre-2011 truck.
      That points at `max_brake_decel_g` being low and the boost quietly
      compensating, so the fix is probably to raise the base and drop the
      multiplier rather than to nerf the emergency stop. Needs an owner call
      on feel, since it moves every stop in the game.
      (b) NOTHING EVER LOCKS UP. The jake has a traction cap and
      `jake_slipping` to start a trolley jackknife; the foundation brakes
      have no equivalent. Grip does scale the force correctly (measured: 5.49
      dry, 3.85 wet, 0.99 on glare ice, all under the tire limit), so the
      truck is never superhuman -- it simply always makes a clean stop, with
      no lockup, no lost steering and no jackknife however hard it is slammed
      on ice. There is no ABS modelled either, so this is idealised rather
      than either era of real truck. The bigger of the two jobs.
- [ ] **PARKED BRANCH `worktree-speech-endorsements-1.9` (e780ab21, pushed).
      The drive-time speech ladder, held until the endorsement slice starts
      (owner, 2026-08-16).** 28 commits of speech work despite the branch
      name -- there is NO endorsement code on it yet, which is what it is
      waiting for. Ready otherwise, and verified rather than assumed:
      `feat/career-1.9` is merged INTO it as of 623a0bc6 (two conflicts, both
      from the same day -- the settings import still carried the removed
      `ENFORCEMENT_PRESENCE_LEVELS`, and both sides had appended a roadmap
      bullet in one spot), full suite 4011 passed, adversarial 34 passed with
      one xfail matching this branch, ruff and compileall clean, four harness
      scenarios CLEAN.
      WHAT THE MERGE EXPOSED, now fixed on that branch at e780ab21: the
      branch had documented a KNOWN_OPEN on `settings_flips_mid_drive` where
      a CONFIRMATION takes the pacer's protected hand-back slot, so the next
      interrupting main-channel line resurfaces a finished confirmation over
      the line the player just asked for. Rare until this branch met
      `fix/asked-for-speech-cuts`, which made every info key an interrupting
      main-channel line -- probed on the merged tree, S spoke the limit and
      the stale "Transmission changed to manual." came straight back behind
      it. `_track` now refuses the slot to a CONFIRMATION whatever priority
      it carries, the KNOWN_OPEN entry is deleted in the same change as the
      strict XPASS asks, and two pacer tests pin both halves.
      KEEP MERGING career-1.9 INTO IT while it waits; the overlap with the
      speech work is where the surprises are.
- [ ] **Drive-time chattiness: even terse is far too much (owner,
      2026-08-15) -- next speech-redesign target, grounded in
      accessibility practice.** The terse contract compressed each
      message; the drive is still too chatty because compression does
      not reduce the NUMBER of things spoken. The grounding from
      accessibility practice points at four principles the current
      design only half-applies:
      (1) Sound before speech (Game Accessibility Guidelines: key
      information carried by audio cues; audio-game convention:
      continuous state belongs in continuous sound -- engine pitch,
      surface texture, panning -- events in earcons, speech ONLY for
      what sound cannot carry, like numbers and instructions). Candidate:
      a systematic pass converting spoken state updates (speed drift,
      gaps opening, weather shifts) to the earcon/sonification layer,
      speech kept only for the first occurrence as a teaching pair. The
      ladder's three earcons (Coaching note, Status note, the reused
      Hazard clear chime) now play for real (see above) -- what remains
      is everything past those three categories: speed drift, gaps
      opening, and weather shifts have no sonified substitute at all yet
      and still speak in full every time regardless of rung.
- [ ] **Per-minute cruise speech budget (principle 3 of the drive-time
      chattiness redesign above).** The live-region politeness model's
      missing half: the S1 pacer already drops stale AMBIENT lines, but
      nothing yet caps how many polite messages a busy stretch of road
      can queue in a minute at cruise. Add the budget so a jammed
      stretch coalesces or defers to the message log instead of
      speaking a backlog late.
- [x] **`Disposition.FIRST_OCCURRENCE` and `Disposition.TRANSITIONS`
      are implemented.** Shipped 2026-08-17. Both behaved exactly like
      FULL because `Settings.speaks()` branches on EARCON/SILENT alone,
      so standard's own table was a promise nothing kept. The
      bookkeeping cannot live in `Settings` (it needs per-line memory),
      so it sits in `GameContext` beside the pacer: `_ladder_said` is
      leg-scoped for FIRST_OCCURRENCE, reset from
      `DrivingUpdateMixin.update` on a leg change, and `_ladder_last`
      holds the last text per key for TRANSITIONS -- identical text is
      the condition re-asserting itself, changed text is the transition.

      `reset_event_condition` clears the last-text memory too. Without
      that, a condition that genuinely cleared and came back word for
      word never spoke again; the air-brake lockout test caught it,
      which is the "swallows a genuine re-warning" failure the original
      review of this area forbade.

- [x] **Curve records that contradict their own geometry are screened at
      load (2026-08-17).** Found in an owner playtest: a 160 ft "hairpin"
      on US-285 turning 79.9 degrees over 53 feet of road, where that
      geometry needs 223. Both existing screens passed it correctly -- it is
      in real mountain terrain, which they deliberately leave alone. The new
      screen asks only whether a record agrees with itself, which terrain
      cannot excuse: span against the arc its own radius and deflection
      require, plus zero-tangent opposite-direction pairs (the digitized-kink
      signature, and what caught this one). Drops 1,190 of 51,231 surviving
      mainline rows, 2.3%. Connectors exempt, matching the screens above.

- [x] **Advisories are capped at the top of the table they come from
      (2026-08-23).** MEASURED on the full bake, not the four-route sample:
      21,076 of 63,873 rows (33 percent) advised over 80 and the worst read
      115, on radii from 1,517 to 2,999 ft.

      The advisory is AASHTO's point-mass control solved for V, and that
      control's friction table is published for 20 through 80 mph and stops
      there, because no US road is designed above 80 -- the highest posted
      limit in the country is the 85 on Texas SH-130. So 115 was never a
      claim about a road; it was arithmetic past the edge of its own table.
      `ADVISORY_MAX_MPH` is that edge, in `data/curves.py` (load-time
      repricing for superelevation cannot climb back over it), in
      `tools/straw_curve_sample.py` (a fresh sweep is born clamped) and in
      `tools/clamp_curve_advisories.py` for the rows already on disk.

      CLAMPED RATHER THAN RECOMPUTED, deliberately. The advisory is a pure
      function of radius so re-deriving the column looked tempting and is
      wrong: the bake computes it from the UNROUNDED apex radius and stores
      the radius rounded, so recomputing from the stored integer moves 95
      correct rows that sit on a 5 mph boundary. Clamping touches only rows
      over the cap, which is also what makes the pass idempotent.

      Nothing audible moved, as predicted: an advisory above the posted limit
      never fires a pacenote, never counts as corner overspeed and never eases
      cruise.
- [x] **The coaching rung is removed (2026-08-17).** Measured on two
      scenarios after the dispositions went in: byte-identical transcripts
      against standard, 6 and 8 lines each. The rung's two cells only bite
      where a coaching tip repeats, and exactly one line in the game carries
      `SpeechCategory.COACHING`. An inaudible setting is worse than one
      fewer setting here -- a player cycling it hears nothing change and
      reasonably concludes it is broken. `DRIVING_SPEECH_MODES` is now
      three; a saved "coaching" migrates to standard through the existing
      unknown-rung fallback. The CATEGORY and its earcon stay.

- [ ] **Coaching's technique tips, and the rung to hold them.** The reason
      the rung was removed rather than kept: there is nothing to say in it.
      Writing the tips means adding COACHING-category lines (there is one
      today, chains hammering above the safe speed) and re-adding the rung
      as one row of `DRIVING_SPEECH_DISPOSITIONS` plus its menu copy. The
      FIRST_OCCURRENCE machinery standard uses to blunt them is already
      built and tested, so the rung would be audibly different from standard
      the day the first tip lands.

      Worth knowing before writing them: the status readouts that repeat
      mostly carry a changed number, which is a genuine worsening and
      correctly still speaks at standard. So a tip only earns the rung its
      difference if it is the kind of thing that would otherwise be said
      more than once per leg.
- [x] **Urgent only's NAVIGATION row is a genuine act-now filter (final
      review of this branch, finding 5).** Shipped 2026-08-17 as the
      option the bullet asked for: a real filter inside NAVIGATION rather
      than a declaration that the taxonomy split was already enough.
      NAVIGATION_ADVISORY carries the lookahead half -- the lead
      announcement ("in a mile, take exit 42"), the bend coming, the place
      still miles off -- and retires to the Road ahead note earcon at
      urgent only while NAVIGATION keeps the turn itself, the exit, and the
      stop. Measured on a headless I-65 run: quiet 29 lines, urgent only
      26, against 0 apart before. Player-facing copy went back to a real
      promise in the same change (settings row, its help text, the user
      manual, docs/ontology.md).

      Found while doing it: STOP_AHEAD looks like a lookahead and is not --
      "Road Ranger at exit 292 in one mile. Press X to signal" names the key
      that takes the stop, so a tone in its place removes the only way to
      pull in rather than making the drive quieter. It stays act-now, the
      same rule the pacing module already gives for CONFIRMATION.

      The bullet's real cause was structural and is worth keeping written
      down: before this, quiet and urgent only differed in COACHING and
      STATUS alone, and both were already inaudible at quiet -- so the two
      quietest rungs were the same setting with different names. A test now
      fails if any future table lands back in that shape.
- [ ] **A stale CONFIRMATION line can resurface and bury what the player
      just asked for (found by task 10, adversarial scenario
      `settings_flips_mid_drive`).** A `CONFIRMATION` line (e.g.
      "Transmission changed to manual.") is usually spoken with
      `interrupt=True` and no explicit `priority=`, so `say_event`
      defaults it to `EventPriority.CRITICAL` -- and the pacer's
      protected-hand-back slot, built to rescue a ROUTE or CRITICAL line
      an interrupt plausibly cut off mid-sentence, holds onto it on the
      same terms. The next interrupting line on the main channel (an S
      query, another settings flip) purges the channel and hands the
      confirmation back to be requeued, even though it already finished
      speaking and what it reported may already be contradicted -- and it
      resurfaces after, sometimes burying, the line the player actually
      just asked for. Recorded as a strict xfail in
      `tests/adversarial/test_break_scenarios.py::KNOWN_OPEN`. Needs a
      pacer design change so CONFIRMATION does not occupy the
      ROUTE/CRITICAL hand-back slot; out of scope for task 10.
- [x] **Speech-priority redesign, stage S3 -- landed 2026-08-12** (R6, R7,
      R9, R10, R11, R12, R14). The naming diet and the noise cuts: facility
      names speak in full on first mention per leg and short after, with the
      type prefix dropped when the proper name already carries it (R6);
      demonstrated instructions retire -- engine start, the controls-help
      pointer, the exit-signal prompt stop repeating once the player has done
      them, gated on a persisted counter keyed to control binding and
      transmission so a remap or a manual gearbox re-teaches (R7); achievement
      flavor leaves the drive entirely, mid-drive announce is earcon plus name
      in both modes and the settlement collapses a run's badges to one named
      row, flavor kept in the log and the achievements menu (R9); the
      settlement drops the rows that report the unremarkable default -- no new
      damage, a full tank, an undamaged truck, the empty career-messages
      placeholder, the standing carrier-charges note (R10); the load-damage
      coaching tail speaks once per episode, escalations carry only the new
      number (R11); off-pavement becomes a standing condition -- speech at
      transitions only (entry, worse, back on), the pre-existing panned
      edge-rumble ladder carrying position in between (R12); and the dodge
      outcome pair (hazard-clear and collision) is learnable on both sides in
      the sounds screen (R14).
- [x] **The chatter switches work in terse -- landed 2026-08-15** (owner:
      "Roadside chatter is pinned to the normal or terse setting. When
      terse, the individual settings don't mean anything"). Terse returned
      before the five switches were consulted, so a terse player had five
      switches on by default that did nothing. The switch decides what is
      spoken and verbosity decides how much is said about it: an enabled
      category now speaks in terse as its short form -- the name and the
      fact, framing dropped -- built as a SpokenMessage pair
      (`speech_text.roadside_chatter`) like the rest of the S2 work.
      Villages are untouched; they answer to the place-callouts ladder.
      Principle (2) above, in miniature: the switch is the ladder, and
      verbosity stops overriding it.

      BILLBOARDS ARE NOW EXEMPT FROM THE CUT (2026-08-22). "The name and
      the fact" is the right short form for a category whose line is a
      LABEL wrapped in framing -- a river, a park boundary, a pass. A
      billboard is not a label: it is the sign's own words, and the payload
      is usually the last sentence, so the cut handed back the setup without
      the punchline ("Meteor Crater is ahead, a hole in the desert nearly a
      mile wide", never "It is bigger than it sounds. Much bigger."). The
      function already spared gags under sixty characters for exactly this
      reason; the placed billboard signs run long and were cut anyway, which
      is what Brandon heard. Both billboard categories now keep the whole
      line at every rung, framing included, and the dedicated billboards
      switch is the control for a player who wants fewer of them -- it was
      always the better one than hearing half of each.
- [x] **Exit traffic speaks only for the exit you are taking -- landed
      2026-08-15** (owner, the same day as the chattiness note above: "when
      exits come up, the game announces traffic info for that exit. Suppress
      all of those types of announcements unless the player signals for the
      exit"). Every route stop grows an exit-traffic pressure a couple of
      miles ahead of itself, so a corridor thick with truck stops narrated
      exit after exit the driver had no intention of using. The advisory is
      now gated in the driving layer on the exit being signalled -- or on
      lane keeping taking it for the driver -- and the trip marks the
      pressure announced either way, so arming late cannot dump a stale
      call. Merge, construction-taper and traffic-pack pressures are
      untouched: they warn about the road the truck is already on. A first
      concrete cut under principle (4) above, announce on change not on
      state.
- [ ] R12 follow-up: redline and low-air are still discrete re-speaks rather
      than the transition-plus-continuous-cue model off-pavement now uses. The
      transition speech is straightforward; the continuous half wants an
      engine-strain tone for redline that the pack does not yet carry, so it
      rides the sound-hunt list with the cruise earcon below.
- [ ] A dedicated cruise-adjust earcon for terse mode's curve composite
      (the easing clause currently folds into the pacenote; the curve
      chime plus audible deceleration carry it), auditioned alongside the
      other sound-hunt needs and added to the learn-sounds screen.
- [ ] **Remaining tester findings from the same document.** At least one
      unexplained sound (a whoosh on the left). Landed 2026-09-01: slower
      on-ramp traffic waits off the mainline and joins behind the truck;
      only a vehicle already pulling away with a four-second gap may merge
      ahead. Landed 2026-08-12: work-zone closures
      keep one authoritative side so the announced lane always matches
      the coned lane, and spoken-event dedup stops standing warnings
      re-reading themselves and stale speech replaying after a pause.
- [x] **Owner manual playtest round -- landed 2026-08-12.** Five real
      playtest_road sessions over the tester-fix build verified the
      work-zone side authority, the lane-return cue, the speech dedup
      across a 25-minute pause, the once-per-episode air warning, and
      the name-entry caret by ear -- and surfaced five more bugs, all
      fixed the same day: a blown stop at a no-chain destination ramp
      terminal stranded the drive silently while cruise auto-resumed
      into it (now the fourth loop-back, with cruise held off the whole
      ramp); hazard warnings offered lane changes on roads with no lane
      to change into; the posted-limit drop spoke three times and too
      late to act on; the hazard assist pumped the service brakes (an
      air cost per re-press, which is what kept draining the tanks) and
      its emergency escalation never reached the wheels; and a dead NWS
      station pinned its route cell to simulated fallback forever (the
      fetch now walks to the next-nearest live station).
- [x] **Speed keeper holds street speed on access roads -- landed
      2026-08-12** (Armstrong's report, secondhand). Three defects: the
      keeper's number could only fall, so a session begun on a 15 mph
      service way crawled the whole facility approach while the zones
      announced 25; the ease window priced the whole shed at entry
      speed (40 percent early on a 25-to-15 drop, crawled rather than
      re-planned since the eased number became a held floor); and a
      slower lead anywhere in the traffic bubble's 2.5-mile reach was
      matched outright with no distance test. All three fixed with the
      spoken hand-back-up line; queue creep and hand-set speeds
      unchanged.
- [x] **Traffic drove at fixed speeds while the map got faster.** The
      intent bands were absolute mph (cruising 52-64, merging 38-52,
      braking 35-48) chosen before real OSM speed limits were baked per
      leg, and they never moved when the map did. On a 75 mph Texas
      corridor the whole population ran 20-40 mph under the road, which
      the driver met as a lead-vehicle cue telling them to leave room for
      30 for a semi on an interstate (owner playtest, 2026-08-15). Speeds
      are now drawn as offsets from the posting at the spawn mile, with
      the floor a share of that limit rather than one absolute number, so
      the same bands suit a 75 corridor and a 30 mph street. NPCs read the
      car limit, not the truck cap, so in a split-limit state the traffic
      going by a rig held to 55 is doing a legal 65.
- [x] **Adaptive cruise's own limit lookahead ignores time compression --
      FIXED 2026-09-01.** The cause was two clocks: the truck sheds speed in
      game seconds, but the working setpoint cruise chases walks down at
      `CRUISE_ACCEL_MPH_PER_S` in REAL seconds, so at twenty times the truck
      covered four miles of road during a 70-to-35 ease that the physics
      sized at half a mile. `acc_limit_lookahead_mi` now takes the larger of
      the physics distance and the ramp distance at the effective time
      scale, and the scan horizon opens with compression up to the spoken
      warning's `LIMIT_WARNING_MAX_LEAD_MI`, so cruise never eases for a
      number the driver has not been told about. Real time is unchanged.
- [x] **Adversarial battery findings, 2026-08-12 run (31 scenarios: 28
      clean, 3 odd) -- all three SHIPPED.** A gate-overshoot loop-back
      repositioned the truck on 20 minutes of free time with the HOS
      driving clock never moving; it now charges real hours-of-service and
      fatigue and burns idle-rate fuel for the loop, so the spoken "the
      clock is still running" line is true. A settlement that jumps
      several career levels announced only the last one; every rank
      passed now gets its own "Level up" line with its own unlock. The
      streak-compounded short-hop XP edge is addressed by the streak-cap
      fix below.
- [x] Short-hop XP farming reined in: the on-time streak bonus is capped
      at the mileage XP (25-mile-hop efficiency 4.9x to 4.6x versus a
      500-mile haul, honest pacing to level 30 unchanged at 335 hours).
      The remaining gap is the flat completion XP, kept by design.
- [x] **Five small bug fixes, 2026-08-12.** A trooper's out-of-service
      order now shuts the engine down like every other overnight stop
      instead of leaving it running while the wake-up line told the
      driver to start it. Docking and pickup check-in gates, and a
      settling POI stop, now snap engine audio to idle instead of
      freezing at the approach's revs -- the same fix already shipped for
      roadside stops, now shared through one `_settle_engine_to_idle`
      helper. Running off the road asleep a third or later time now
      speaks the real count instead of freezing at "twice now".
- [x] **Billboards, round two, 2026-08-12.** Seventeen new owner-written
      roadside boards in the rotation (roadfood, trucker-commerce, and
      fourth-wall genres), plus song tribute boards for the achievement
      catalog: forty-plus signs on the corridors that raised the music,
      corridor-keyed (nineteen new shield keys) or riding a low-weight
      tribute pool that draws about one sign in ten. Titles and artist
      names only, never lyric quotes.
- [x] **Billboards are placed, not just corridor-keyed (2026-08-24).**
      Reported as "OKC billboards in Tennessee". Two faults, both in the
      lookup: the corridor pool was keyed on the shield alone, so every
      place a sign named was true the whole length of an interstate
      (Interstate 40 runs through Oklahoma AND Tennessee), and the shield
      key dropped the prefix, so US-90, AZ-90 and SR-80 all inherited an
      interstate's roadside. Every corridor line now carries a
      `SignAnchor` -- `Corridor` for a line that names no place, `States`
      for a region or an unmodelled town, `Approaching` for a world city
      within `SIGN_APPROACH_MI` (150) of route ahead -- and the placer
      refuses a sign anywhere its copy is untrue, falling through to the
      anywhere pool. Two lines were evicted from the national tribute
      pool for naming places (redwood country, the Appalachian hollers)
      and re-anchored on Interstate 5 and Interstate 77. Measured by
      `crates/ff-core/tests/it/sim_billboard_placement.rs`, a 288-run
      seeded sweep with a geography oracle independent of the anchor
      table: 996 of 1608 place-naming billboards misplaced (61.9%) before,
      0 of 684 after, with corridor character up rather than down.
- [ ] Billboard tribute copy could use one more polish pass with the
      owner's own eye -- shipped at "good enough for now" after three
      revision rounds; the closer style rules are in the module docstring.
- [ ] Two billboard authoring calls the anchor pass surfaced and could not
      settle itself. "Meramec-style caverns ahead" sits in the Interstate
      40 pool, but the real Meramec Caverns is on Interstate 44 in
      Missouri; it is anchored to Arkansas as Ozark cavern country, on the
      strength of the "-style" hedge, and wants an owner's eye. And eleven
      signs name towns the world has no node for (Biloxi, Okemah, Abbott,
      Fort Payne, Newnan, Hope, Nazareth, Moorcroft, Dyess, Ionia, Wall),
      so they anchor to a state rather than an approach; adding any of
      those as a world city would let its sign tighten to a real approach.
- [ ] Split the first-drive tutorial across multiple runs (owner call,
      future session). Interacts with the speech redesign's R15 rule:
      first-run guidance is exempt from verbosity until the walkthrough
      completes, so a multi-run tutorial changes what "complete" means.
- [ ] The playtest rig records speech submissions, not deliveries -- it
      bypasses the real pacer, so transcripts cannot show dropped or
      cut-off lines. Route the rig through the pacer (or add a
      pacer-aware mode) so the adversarial battery can catch speech
      regressions.
- [ ] The blown ramp terminal and missed street turn loop-backs still
      charge only clock time -- same free-time defect fixed for the
      facility gate and destination exit; apply `_charge_scripted_loop`
      to both.
- [ ] **The no-engine-brake ban only knows route cities.** It rides
      `URBAN_RADIUS_MI` (6.0) around route nodes, so small towns a leg
      merely passes through are not modelled at all -- in a survey only
      17 of 70 assisted curves fell inside any ban zone, and 4 of 26 on
      one mountain route. An assist-raised retarder can never be fined
      (`driver_owns_jake` excludes it), so this is realism rather than a
      money bug, but it is why the retarder barks through bends an
      experienced driver reads as a ticket waiting to happen. Widening
      the radius is an owner call.
- [x] **Fines rebalanced against real trucking penalties -- SHIPPED
      2026-08-11** on `feat/fines-rebalance`, merged after the driver-assist
      fixes so the penalties land on player error. Unsafe equipment to 2,300,
      weigh station bypass to 1,800, chain law to 580, following too
      close to 600, lane misuse to 500, shoulder to 400, lights to 350,
      failure to stop to 1,500. A 2x multiplier inside a construction
      zone (taper included) and repeat-offender escalation extended from
      speeding to every fine, compounding rather than adding. All amounts
      and both multipliers now live in `models/enforcement.py` behind one
      `citation_fine` helper; `CHAIN_LAW_FINE` had two live definitions
      on different paths, one shadowing the other, now collapsed.
- [x] **Detention, lumper fees, washouts and tolls now move money -- SHIPPED
      2026-08-28** on `feat/1.9-realism-wins`. The existing settlement
      ledger applies to the owner-operator wallet: detention pays them,
      lumpers, washouts, and tolls charge them. Company drivers still hear
      the ledger; it is billed to the carrier and is not a personal check.
      Found by the 2026-08-11 realism
      audit; full report in `docs/realism-audit-2026-08.md`.
- [x] **PrePass-style weigh-in-motion bypass -- SHIPPED 2026-08-20** (owner-
      approved design, from Brandon's realism-audit report below). A
      transponder-equipped truck now gets a green/red verdict as it
      approaches an open scale instead of the blanket "all trucks must pull
      in": green rolls past with no charge, red pulls in exactly like the
      old flow. Company drivers get one free at career level 4
      (`business.WEIGH_STATION_TRANSPONDER_LEVEL`); owner-operators
      subscribe from Business status for a per-mile settlement reserve
      (`business.has_weigh_station_transponder`, `owner_operator_charges`).
      The bypass share is a named seeded roll off the trip seed and the
      stop, in `driving_updates._resolve_transponder_verdict`.

      CLOSED 2026-08-28 on `feat/1.9-realism-wins`: dispatched cargo is
      clamped to 80,000 lb GVW on a stock tractor and trailer, and
      `cargo_is_overweight()` is tractor + trailer + cargo against that
      cap (fuel is not counted). An overweight truck is always red-lighted
      at a transponder scale.
- [ ] **Weigh-in-motion bypass should be per-site, not everywhere.** Today
      every open scale runs the transponder verdict on one flat seeded
      share, so a transponder effectively works at every scale in the
      country. It does not work that way. There are roughly 680-750 fixed
      weigh stations in the US; PrePass covers 550+ sites in 44 states and
      Drivewyze 900+ across 47 states and provinces, the two do not
      overlap cleanly, and a carrier normally subscribes to one -- so a
      real driver meets plenty of open scales that simply do not know
      them. Bypass is negotiated per site with each state DOT.

      Three real rules worth having, in the order they are worth doing:

      1. A bypass-equipped flag baked per scale in the world data, so some
         scales give a verdict and some are always the old flow. Provenance
         rule applies: a flag we invent is **assumed**, and must say so --
         published participating-site lists are the **read** source where
         one can be had.
      2. Safety score gates it. California, Alabama and Idaho refuse bypass
         to carriers with an ISS score above 75, which maps straight onto
         the reputation and driving-record state the game already keeps:
         a driver with a poor record loses the privilege in those states
         while keeping it elsewhere. This is the half with the most
         gameplay in it.
      3. Two states put the verdict on a sign instead of in the cab.
         Wisconsin and Idaho require following the message board rather
         than an in-cab signal, which is a genuinely different spoken
         experience from a green tone and worth its own line.

      Sources: prepass.com/bypass, drivewyze.com/resources/coverage-map,
      drivewyze.com/help/bypass-restrictions. Raised by the owner during
      the 2026-08-21 playtest session, after driving the scale flow by
      hand; deferred to the following week.
- [x] **Relaxed hours-of-service keeps the real 11 / 14 / 30 -- SHIPPED
      2026-08-28** on `feat/1.9-realism-wins`. Relaxed no longer multiplies
      the clock by 1.25. It halves fines and scale-house inspection odds.
      Speech does not say 13.75 as hours of service.

- [x] **Scale wave-through is a couple of minutes, and a missed 30-minute
      break is 30 minutes out of service -- SHIPPED 2026-08-28** on
      `feat/1.9-realism-wins`. Pulling into an open scale and being waved
      through burns two minutes, not the inspection lane's fifteen. A
      blown 30-minute break parks you thirty minutes on the shoulder with
      the break satisfied; drive or duty still takes the ten-hour reset.
- [ ] **Two roadmap claims are already false.** Split sleeper berth (8/2
      and 7/3) is fully implemented despite lines further down this file
      saying twice that it is not. Also worth knowing: the 30-minute
      break rule is implemented to the current 2020 regulation, and at
      least one practitioner source still describes the pre-2020 version
      -- following that source would break working code.
- [x] **The barrel citation is no longer doubled for the zone -- SHIPPED
      2026-08-11.** It was the one citation that can only happen inside a
      construction zone, so the multiplier always applied and it was
      always charged 2,000. Its base is Missouri RSMo 304.585, already
      the work-zone-specific penalty, which caps a first offense at
      1,000 -- doubling charged twice for the same aggravating fact. The
      zone multiplier now applies only to offenses whose base is not
      already zone-specific. Priors still escalate it.
- [ ] **Spoken "work zone" contradicts the ontology.** `sim/trip.py`
      lines 2229 and 2234 speak "Work zone active" where
      `docs/ontology.md` makes "construction zone" canonical. Pre-existing
      drift, found while fixing the lane trap.
- [x] **A resolved enforcement stop re-speaks its fine amount -- FIXED
      2026-08-19.** Seen live in Darren's log: the same 1,200 dollar citation
      spoken twice, three seconds apart, word for word. `_resolve` charges
      once and that was never in question, but a driver with no screen had no
      way to tell a repeat from a second ticket. Now led in the past tense
      ("Reading back the stop you have already settled") and not silenced,
      because re-reading the stop is the only route back to the detail.

      STILL OPEN: what called `announce_entry` twice. The fine is charged
      once and the repeat is now distinguishable, so the player-facing harm
      is gone, but the double call itself is unexplained.

      Superseded description follows.
- [ ] **A resolved enforcement stop re-speaks its fine amount.**
      Re-entering a settled stop replays the whole line including the
      dollar figure without charging anything, because `_resolve()` runs
      in `__init__` and `announce_entry` has no once-guard. The money is
      safe, but the repeat is word-for-word identical to a fresh charge,
      so there is no way to tell one from the other. Lead a re-entry with
      past tense instead; do not silence it, since re-reading the stop is
      the only way back to the detail.

- [x] **Break-harness findings now assert what they claim, and the one
      real one is fixed -- SHIPPED 2026-08-10.** Triaging the harness's
      2026-08-09 findings against transcripts, four of nine were
      artifacts rather than game bugs, and acting on them would have
      meant "fixing" working code: `slam_reverse_at_speed` called
      `Transmission.request_gear` beneath the road-speed guard the gear
      keys actually reach; `hazard_ignored_to_100_damage` compared a
      mid-run spoken line against post-rescue damage;
      `neutral_coast_mountain` hardcoded "no mechanical failure" while
      its own transcript walked the truck to out of service; and
      `hos_marathon_and_rest_cheese` appended a finding in the `else` of
      a check whose `if` asserts the opposite, so it could never come
      back clean. All four now check the consequence instead of
      asserting its absence. 26 clean, 5 odd, down from 9.
      `reverse_down_the_route` was the real one: a mile backed down an
      interstate with no wrong-way feedback of any kind, an
      accessibility gap before a realism one, since the only spoken line
      was a merge instruction for the exit being reversed away from. New
      `states/driving_wrong_way.py` ladders remind -> illegal -> traffic
      on distance backed, exempting the yard, stops and the receiver's
      gate zone.
- [x] Break-harness findings, all now shipped: the facility-gate loop-back
      now charges HOS driving time, fatigue, and idle fuel alongside the
      20 game minutes; a multi-level settlement now speaks one line per
      rank passed; short-hop streak XP is addressed by the streak-cap fix
      earlier in this section. (The save/reload hazard finding was closed
      2026-08-11 as not reachable -- see the bullet below on why serializing
      it would be
      worse.)
- [x] **A full lot no longer closes the fuel island -- SHIPPED
      2026-08-10.** Owner-reported from a live run. `_open_poi_stop`
      diverted to `ParkingFullState` whenever a stop carried `sleep` and
      the overnight crunch rolled full (20:00-04:00), and that `return`
      swallowed the whole stop -- so the biggest truck stops, the ones
      most likely to carry `sleep`, were exactly the ones that turned a
      driver away from their pumps overnight, with running dry the
      likely outcome. The fuel purchase moved to a `_FuelPumpMixin`
      shared by `RestStopState` and `ParkingFullState`, and the full-lot
      menu now leads with the pumps when the stop has them. Note for
      later: the game models no opening hours at all (the scraped
      `opening_hours` OSM tags in `data/spider/vehicle-access-cache.json`
      are dead data), so nothing else is time-gated -- if stop hours are
      ever wanted, fuel islands should stay 24-hour.
- [x] **Load-shift realism retune -- SHIPPED 2026-08-10.** Benched
      through `tools/playtest_road.py` (which now reports cargo
      condition, peak deceleration and worst bend overspeed in its
      headless trace) and found two faults. Braking: the threshold sat
      at 0.25 g against a truck whose service brakes top out at 0.35 g,
      so one full application from 65 mph cost general freight 13.3 pct
      -- past the exception line -- and food 31.9 pct. Securement is
      rated to 0.8 g forward under 49 CFR 393.102, which no Class 8 rig
      can reach, so the threshold moved to 0.45 g: full service stops
      are free, the emergency application (0.58 g measured) costs about
      3 pct, and a grade adding its own g still bites. Cornering: the
      model read raw mph over the advisory, which ranked bends backwards
      -- a 472 ft sweeper at +15 cost 7.1 pct while a 198 ft hairpin at
      the same +15, pulling 0.68 g against the sweeper's 0.51, cost only
      2.8 pct. Rebuilt on geometric lateral g from the curve's own
      `min_radius_ft` (new `TruckState.corner_lateral_g`, fed by
      `driving_damage`, with an advisory-derived fallback for legs whose
      data carries no radius), threshold 0.40 g -- above every shipped
      advisory, below the 0.5 g lateral securement rating. Every bend in
      the game is now free at its posted advisory.
- [x] **Test-suite streamlining, first pass -- SHIPPED 2026-08-10.**
      The count was never the problem. 6,614 of the 9,720 tests lived in
      `tests/test_radio.py`, and 6,599 of those were one parametrised
      function doing field-presence checks on static catalog rows: 89 s
      of near-pure pytest overhead at ~13 ms an assertion. Collapsed to
      a single sweep that reports every bad entry at once (89.21s ->
      2.00s), plus the tuning test that walked all 5,092 receivable
      stations to prove a set membership (33.5s -> 0.32s). Suite is
      9,720 -> 3,122 with no coverage lost. Separately, `-n auto` on the
      28-core developer machine was not merely pinning the CPU, it was
      dying with an INTERNALERROR in the reporter -- almost certainly the
      same "node down" the CI xdist notes describe. Worker curve on 140
      driving tests is flat past eight (n=4 48s, n=8 31s, n=16 31s), so
      `tests/conftest.py` now implements xdist's
      `pytest_xdist_auto_num_workers` hook and caps auto at 8; CI runners
      are below the ceiling and unaffected.
- [x] **Adversarial battery reports through pytest -- SHIPPED
      2026-08-10.** `tests/adversarial/test_break_scenarios.py` runs the
      same registry `tools/playtest_break.py` does, so the scenarios stay
      one source of truth and the CLI (`--scenario NAME --transcript`,
      still the way to read spoken output) is untouched. The ODD-vs-FAIL
      ambiguity that let four bogus findings sit untriaged is gone: a NEW
      odd finding fails, the four known-open ones are strict xfails
      carrying their explanation in `KNOWN_OPEN`, and fixing one turns it
      into XPASS, which fails and says to delete the entry. Marked
      `adversarial` and deselected in addopts; `tests/conftest.py` also
      skips collecting the directory unless the marker is asked for,
      since deselection happens after collection and collecting it pulls
      in pygame and the whole scenario package for nothing. 28 passed,
      4 xfailed in 7 s under the worker cap -- faster than the tool's
      serial run, so the "it is fast because it is outside pytest"
      worry did not survive contact. Watch for: a second conftest under
      `tests/` claims the bare module name `conftest`, which broke
      `test_online_presence.py`'s `from conftest import FakeKeyring`.
      The loader lives in the test module for that reason.
- [ ] **Three adversarial scenarios need triage after the playtest_break
      transcript-capture fix (task 9 of the driving-verbosity-ladder
      plan, 2026-08-16).** `tools/playtest_break.py` and
      `tools/playtest_road.py` used to stub `ctx.say`/`ctx.say_event`
      themselves, which sits outside `GameContext.say`/`say_event` and
      so skipped the event pacer entirely -- every transcript either
      tool ever produced showed every line a scenario's code path
      attempted, not what a player actually hears once repeat
      suppression runs. Fixed to stub the voice layer
      (`ctx.speech.say`/`say_event`) instead. With the real pacer now
      running, three scenarios turned ODD that were CLEAN before:
      `fuel_rescue_farming` (expects 3 identical roadside-rescue
      announcements, gets 1 -- may be a genuine silent-second-rescue
      accessibility gap, or just the scenario's own timing landing
      inside the repeat window), `scale_check_in_guidance` ("T mid
      scale warning" response goes missing), and
      `settings_flips_mid_drive` (a direct call to `_speak_speed_limit`
      lands inside the repeat window of an earlier routine
      announcement and is correctly dropped, so the assertion reads a
      stale `transcript[-1]`). None investigated further -- out of
      scope for a proof-and-paperwork task. Each needs a human to judge
      real bug vs. stale scenario-script assumption, then either a
      small scenario-script fix (advance past `EventSpeechPacer.
      REPEAT_WINDOW_S` before asserting, or read `rig.said(...)`/
      `lines_with(...)` deltas instead of `transcript[-1]`) or a
      `KNOWN_OPEN` entry in `tests/adversarial/test_break_scenarios.py`.
- [x] **Passing traffic you can actually hear -- SHIPPED 2026-08-10**
      (player-requested). Five bugs in the existing bubble, no redesign:
      traffic was stepped on the raw `time_scale` while everything else
      ran on `effective_time_scale`, against that property's own
      docstring, so NPCs slid relative to the truck whenever pacing eased;
      `spawn_initial_traffic` drew one candidate per 85 miles, once, and
      never replaced what the cull retired, so the bubble drained as a run
      went on; everything was seeded ahead, so the `passing` intent could
      never pass; `_leg_density` was multiplied by `hazard_scale` (the
      relaxed-mode hazard knob times the time-scale tuning's hazard
      frequency, landing at 0.11), which is the rule enforcement already
      settled -- presence is not difficulty; and no pass earcon existed
      for bubble vehicles at all. Now: a rolling window that spawns ahead
      and behind with deterministic per-cell draws, clear air around the
      cab so nothing materialises alongside, a drawn exit mile so a slow
      vehicle cannot pin the truck for the rest of the route, density
      tracking the live local hour rather than the departure hour, and
      `states/driving_traffic_pass.py` firing a class-matched whoosh
      panned to the side, rate-limited in REAL seconds because ten times
      pacing turned a populated road into a cue every 2.2 seconds.
      Measured: bubble 0-3 -> 10-19 vehicles, pass-bys 0 -> 4-7 per 6 mi,
      cues across every class. `TrafficManager.rolling_bubble` turns the
      top-up off for tests that hand-place their own road.
- [ ] Traffic follow-ups the above surfaced: the player cannot overtake a
      slow vehicle under automatic lane keeping, so being held up is
      currently resolved only by that vehicle's exit mile -- an actual
      pass manoeuvre is the real answer. Also worth a look: the
      `traffic_slowing` achievement ("Bumper-to-Bumper Blues") was
      unreachable on the old empty road and now fires, so its wording and
      rarity have never been reviewed against real play.
- [x] Superseded detail from the original report, kept for the record:
      (1) **Nothing plays when a vehicle passes.** The cues hang off
      `TrafficManager.next_situation`, which returns a situation only for
      `merging`, `braking` or `following` -- a hazard needing driver
      action -- and only once per vehicle ever
      (`announced_vehicle_keys`). A vehicle simply overtaking is silent.
      This is the same wiring the trooper-cue note in `traffic_manager`
      already describes, and it is wider than the trooper.
      (2) **There is almost nothing out there to pass.** Peak bubble was
      0-3 vehicles at hours 7, 8, 9, 17 and 22, and actual pass-bys --
      an NPC changing which side of the truck it is on -- were ZERO at
      every hour except one trooper at 09:00. Vehicles are culled only
      at 2.0 mi behind, so they are not being lost before crossing;
      `spawn_initial_traffic` seeds them ahead along the leg and nothing
      ever comes up from behind, so the bubble is a set of lead vehicles
      you slowly close on rather than a living road.
      Fixing this needs an overtake event keyed on relative position
      (pan by side, level by closing speed), separate from the hazard
      announcement path, plus enough density for it to fire. The audio
      is not the blocker: `traffic/semi_pass` was replaced 2026-08-10
      with a real Blastwave FX roadside take (peak/median 43x, 1948 rpm
      under load) and it changes nothing until the above lands.
- [ ] Shared App() fixtures, if ever worth it. Measured 2026-08-10 and
      NOT the bottleneck: a boot is 149 ms warm across 83 files, while
      the full suite is 3,114 tests in 3:54. What is left is a handful of
      legitimate broad sweeps -- the network-wide deadline check (58 s),
      the whole-board route check (53 s), and 113 s of full deliveries in
      `test_mapped_state_lines_are_authoritative_in_delivery_transcripts`,
      three params of which are strict xfails re-confirming the ambient
      message-queue bug documented in that file. Fixing that queue
      deletes those xfails and about 90 s with them, which is the real
      lever; trimming the sweeps would trade coverage for seconds.
- [x] **Adversarial "break the game" harness -- SHIPPED 2026-08-09.**
      `tools/playtest_break.py` (plus `tools/playtest_break_scenarios/`,
      split by system family to stay under the practical-file-size
      guideline) drives DrivingState and the menu-flow harness through 31
      deliberately unreasonable scenarios across every system -- physics
      (floor it through town, reverse down the interstate, coast a
      mountain in neutral, dynamite the parking brake at 60), assists
      fighting each other (cruise/curve/descent stacked, the jake-zone
      toggle dodge, the new facility-gate overshoot with the approach
      assist on and off), resources (fuel-rescue farming, a 22-hour HOS
      marathon, micro-rest cheese, a motel room one minute from a
      deadline), career/economy (settlement honesty, the advance-abandon
      cycle, endorsement wallet edges, the level-up boundary, the
      owner-operator buy-in gate at exactly level 18, short-hop streak
      XP farming), dispatch board-reroll farming, save-scum during a
      traffic stop or a live hazard, chain-law and glare-ice physics, and
      radio-dial abuse. Each scenario checks its own invariants (money
      finite, position monotonic, spoken numbers matching real state) so
      a rerun after any change flags regressions without a transcript
      read. `--list` / `--scenario NAME` / `--transcript`; the whole
      battery runs in well under a minute, single process, no window.
      First run: 17 clean, 14 odd findings (see PR/session notes for the
      ranked list) -- none fixed here by design, this lands the harness
      and the findings for the enforcement-overhaul and damage-band work
      already in flight to triage against.
- [x] **Bake the remaining curated billboard sheets -- SHIPPED
      2026-08-09.** All 23 sheets baked with zero copy changes; blockers
      finished the same day at the owner's direction: the sixteen
      stale-leg blocks re-pointed onto today's split corridors (approved
      copy untouched, exit-verified Route 66 placements), and the five
      do-not-bake blocks replaced with new in-style signs (Navasota
      blues capital, Tallahassee canopy roads, Little America, Terre
      Haute's Coca-Cola bottle, Leavenworth's Bavarian village). Final
      tally: `billboard_sign` 42 -> 233 across all sixteen regions,
      `highway_marker` 59; index regenerated and verified. Still open,
      non-blocking: Ape Cave stays held for a future Mount St. Helens
      route per its note, and twenty-odd baked blocks carry soft
      "verify" fact-notes in their sheets for an eventual fact pass.
- [x] **Achievement categories, on Saltwake's model -- SHIPPED
      2026-08-09.** The catalog (172 badges, grown past the planned 145)
      now carries seven categories with per-category earned counts, and
      the Achievements screen browses in two levels exactly on the
      Saltwake shape: category menu first ("title, earned of total"),
      then that category's badges -- earned ones tell their story,
      locked ones keep to their title (the existing no-spoiler idiom),
      and five hidden calendar/number badges stay "a secret the manifest
      is keeping" until earned. Copy tests cover category titles and
      descriptions; the category noun joined docs/ontology.md. Owner
      voice pass over the seven titles/descriptions still worth a
      listen before release.
- [x] **Screen artifact curves out of the highway bake -- SHIPPED
      2026-08-09.** Loader-side screen in `data/curves.py`: interstate
      mainline records under 300 ft radius or over 150 degrees of
      deflection are sweep artifacts (city-anchor departure geometry and
      interchange vertices baked as mainline) and are dropped on load --
      3,113 records, taking interstate mainline hairpins from 1,604 to
      zero. The raw bake keeps every row; ramps/connectors and all
      US/state-route records are untouched (US-550's 36 switchbacks and
      Glenwood Canyon survive verbatim, verified). RESIDUE CLOSED
      2026-08-09: the US/state pass found its discriminator -- local
      terrain at the hairpin's apex (a real hairpin cannot sit on flat
      ground). tools/screen_curve_artifacts.py classifies every
      non-interstate hairpin-severity curve against the archived
      elevation profile and writes curve_artifacts.jsonl (963 flat-
      terrain artifacts across 372 legs, skipped by the loader like the
      interstate screen); all 385 hill/mountain hairpins kept, US-550
      and Salt River Canyon verified untouched, tests pin both sides.
- [x] **No career transfer from 1.8 and earlier -- SHIPPED 2026-08-09
      (owner ruling 2026-08-08).** `created_line` marker on every new
      save; pre-marker 1.9 tester careers pass via the save-version
      discriminator (versions 6+ exist only on the 1.9 line; dev/main
      stopped at 5) and get stamped on first load. The load gate raises
      before migration or resave so old files stay byte-for-byte intact
      and 1.8-playable; legacy careers stay listed with a clear label
      and open a kind notice offering a fresh start; a same-named new
      career refuses to overwrite a legacy save. Cloud restores refuse
      pre-1.9 snapshots three layers deep without deleting anything, and
      orinks-net (branch feat/legacy-restore-gate) pre-clears the marker
      in the validator allow-list. KNOWN IRREDUCIBLE: a 1.8 career a
      tester already continued on an early 1.9 dev build was rewritten
      as v6+ back then and passes the gate -- that history is gone.
      CUTOVER REMINDERS: Convex deploys before any build with the marker
      ships, and the full invariants-export regen (version ceiling to
      11) is still the existing cutover checklist item -- today's dev
      validator still rejects 1.9 uploads as unsupported_version.
- [x] **1.9 data on online profiles -- SHIPPED 2026-08-09** (game merge
      plus orinks-net branch `feat/profile-1-9-fields`). The drivers-board
      line names the tuned station while driving with the radio on
      (detail-string append, board only, display name never a stream
      URL). Durable profile career statistics add lifetime career
      earnings (`Career.total_earnings`, rounded), badges earned out of
      the catalog, endorsements in unlock order, and -- company drivers
      only -- the carrier fleet tier; the server derives all display from
      the invariants export (`endorsements` + `fleetTiers` tables now in
      it), and no new field entered the signed payload. The disclosure,
      Online-hub help, and manual all say it plainly: lifetime earnings
      is public, the current money balance is never published. Pre-1.9
      snapshots render exactly as before (test-pinned). Leaderboards
      deliberately NOT here: they get their own pass (and the per-driver
      vs per-career identity decision) once the 1.9 baseline has real
      data -- they inherit the stats-pinned-to-first-career guard.
      The cutover invariants regen landed on the same preview branch
      (ceiling 5 to 11, stable saves keep validating), so a real 1.9
      build pointed at the preview validates end to end; at dev cutover,
      re-regen if fields drifted and replay stored prod blobs before the
      prod deploy.
- [ ] **Public career should follow the career you open (Shane,
      2026-08-14) -- design decision needed.** The public-career chooser
      (orinks-net dev b2b8a5c, publicSaveName) makes fronting a career a
      manual step, and Shane asks for the active career to become the
      public one automatically. The sharp edge: testers keep throwaway
      fiddle careers, and blind auto-follow would publish an experiment
      the moment it is opened. Leading candidate (Shane's own follow-up):
      ask once per career, spoken -- "do you want this career public on
      the boards?" -- yes is public, no is private but still backed up;
      backups never depend on the answer. Paired suggestion: the drivers
      board names the career in play ("munchkinbear, playing on career
      littlebear"), which would also surface the known presence-vs-stats
      career mismatch honestly instead of hiding it. Owner call before
      any build ships it.
- [x] **Staging validator repaired end to end for honest saves
      (2026-08-14 night).** Three refusal classes fixed in one evening:
      unknown fields from another build line are tolerated (issue #97
      doctrine), the money ceiling credits the richest career start (the
      owner-operator's 18,000 rejected as impossible_money until then --
      the exporter now ships startingMoneyMax), and money may run
      negative because 1.9 debt IS an overdraft. Every rejected upload
      is now retained as evidence, not just the arithmetic families --
      four honest-save bugs in a row had to be diagnosed blind because
      schema-family refusals vanished on arrival. Root operational
      lesson: the branch's Vercel builds never deployed Convex (the
      deploy key was dev-scoped), so fixes "deployed" all evening
      without reaching testers; feat/profile-1-9-fields now carries its
      own production deploy key and auto-deploys to
      scrupulous-ferret-428 on every push, proven in build logs. All
      stuck testers (trssharp, munchkinbear x3 careers, jessie, sarah)
      confirmed backing up the same night.
- [x] **The computer cap's refusal names a control the page has
      (armstrong445, 2026-08-15).** He could not connect the latest build:
      orinks.net refused the activation at the ten-computer cap, and the
      refusal told him to "remove one on the setup page" -- a page whose
      buttons say Sign out and have never said Remove. The site's message
      now names signing out, says why the list fills with the same PC, and
      links to the page (orinks-net dev, 5f5df49).
- [x] **The computer cap counted activations, not computers -- FIXED on
      staging 2026-08-15.** Every freshly unzipped build that connected
      minted another row, so a tester who takes a build a week filled the
      list of ten with one PC and was locked out. A client-side fix
      (remembering the sign-in in the platform secret store) was written
      and REVERTED on owner ruling: a copy extracted to a clean folder must
      be a clean game, and may consult only that folder and the game's
      appdata. The counting is the server's, so the fix is the server's --
      the game names the computer with an opaque hash when the player
      deliberately activates (never a hostname; equality is all it is used
      for), and redeeming replaces that computer's row instead of adding
      one. The cap skips a computer already on the list, so a full account
      can still reconnect the PC it is signed in on, and a build that sends
      no key behaves exactly as before. orinks-net dev 542bb69, deployed to
      staging and verified against dev.orinks.net. An account that already
      collected ghost rows still needs one pass of Sign out all computers.
- [x] **The Online menu opens the driver setup page (owner, 2026-08-15).**
      Follow-up from the above: the recovery for a full computer list, a
      driver rename, or a sharing change all live on a page whose path
      (/freight-fate/online/setup) nobody should have to remember, and the
      game had no way to reach it. New hub row "Open my driver setup page"
      opens `online_presence.setup_page_url()` -- staged host included --
      with the Mastodon opener's clipboard-then-spoken-address fallback for
      remote and streamed sessions. Deliberately its OWN row rather than a
      job the account row takes over once connected: that row is also the
      way back in when orinks.net stops accepting this computer, which is
      the moment a player needs to re-activate rather than browse, and it
      is what AUTH_HELP names.
- [ ] **PRE-RELEASE MUST-DO: point the game back at production.** The
      1.9 test line defaults its online services to the staged
      deployment (dev.orinks.net, the orinks-net dev branch on its own
      Convex backend). Before the 1.9 release: flip DEFAULT_BASE_URL in
      online_presence.py back to PRODUCTION_BASE_URL and drop the
      2026-08-staging entry from PUBLIC_KEYS in cloud_save_integrity.py.
      Staged accounts and backups are test data and do not migrate.
- [x] **Staging restored after Convex collected its backend (2026-08-11).**
      Convex deletes preview deployments five days after they are created
      on the free and starter plans, and it collected the one behind
      dev.orinks.net. Every online surface failed at once -- the drivers
      board, the updates feed, and every driver profile -- and the tester
      accounts, careers, cloud backups, and the staging signing key went
      with it. Staging is running again on a fresh preview deployment
      (charming-terrier-46) with a regenerated signing key, since the old
      private half existed only inside the deleted deployment. Testers
      need a build carrying the new public key before cloud restores
      verify. Staging data does not survive this kind of loss, so treat
      it as throwaway.
- [x] **Staging now runs on a deployment that cannot expire
      (2026-08-11).** dev.orinks.net is served by
      scrupulous-ferret-428, the production deployment of its own Convex
      project (orinks-net-staging2). Production deployments have no
      lifetime, so the five-day preview clock no longer applies to
      staging. The dev branch reaches it through a Vercel
      CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY scoped to Preview (dev), plus CONVEX_DEPLOY_FLAGS
      carrying `--check-build-environment disable` -- Convex otherwise
      refuses a production key from a preview build. Both are
      branch-scoped, so every other branch still gets throwaway previews.
- [ ] **Dead Convex deployment left behind: industrious-parrot-713**
      (project orinks-net-staging), the first attempt. It never accepted
      a push -- three tries, each hanging 300s before a 408 on
      evaluate_push -- while an identically configured deployment
      created minutes later took its first push in 21 seconds. Reported
      to Convex on Discord 2026-08-11. Delete it once they answer, but
      copy the signing key out first: `convex env get` still works on
      it, and it is one of the few places that private half exists.
- [ ] **A first push can fail spuriously.** charming-terrier-46 rejected
      its first push with `InvalidModules: Cannot read properties of
      undefined (reading 'error')`, naming no module, then accepted the
      identical code seconds later. Not universal -- scrupulous-ferret-428
      was fine first time. If a push fails that way, retry before
      believing the commit is broken.
- [x] **Staging cloud backups fixed for 1.9 careers (2026-08-09).** Day
      one of staged testing surfaced it: every company-driver backup was
      silently refused as `invalid_possession`, because the validator's
      possession rule still demanded the career own the trainer rig and
      its active truck -- the 1.8 model that 1.9's dispatch-assigned
      fleet ended (fresh careers own nothing until the level-18 buy-in,
      and the buy-in keeps the assigned tractor, not the rig). Fixed on
      orinks-net dev (4616cf5): possession now checks only that truck
      keys are real and listed once, the forensics-first stance the money
      rule already took. Rides to prod with the normal dev-to-main merge
      at cutover. The game's Cloud backup menu also stops claiming
      "ready" while the setting is off and offers the opt-in in place.
      LESSON FOR THE CUTOVER AUDIT: the invariants-export regen was
      byte-identical and still missed this, because the stale half was
      rule LOGIC, not data -- and replaying stored prod blobs cannot
      catch it either, since every stored blob predates the new model.
      At the dev cutover, replay freshly played 1.9 careers (company new
      hire, slip-seat level 4+, post-buy-in owner-operator) against the
      validator, not just the stored-blob corpus.
- [ ] **THE BACK HALF OF THE ARC IS FLAVOUR TEXT (direction set
      2026-08-09).** An audit of all thirty ranks found every real
      mechanical unlock lives in levels 1-13 (endorsements, regional
      fleet, extra decline, board growth to 6/7/8 offers, choosing your
      own loads at 8, a dedicated tractor at 9, premium fleet at 13).
      Levels 14-16 only make text visible ("Working-capital target
      becomes visible"), and 19-30 are twelve levels of flavour
      ("Specialty trailer programs matter more", "Top career rank").
      That is why the owner-operator start was placed at 18 -- it sat
      exactly where the ladder stopped paying out.
      OWNER RULING: do NOT build a fleet-management layer -- it would
      duplicate the separate dispatch game and drag a blind player out
      of the cab into menus. The first half is EARNING TRUST; the second
      half is CARRYING RISK. Same cab, same road, higher stakes. Every
      addition must pass one test: you can hear and feel the difference
      from the driver's seat. Planned spine: harder freight classes
      (tanker surge first, then oversize/overweight with permits and
      route restrictions, hazmat with route bans and inspection
      scrutiny), dedicated contract lanes you can fail, owned trailers
      with their own upkeep, and authority turning the board into a
      market you price rather than a list you pick from. If the second
      act cannot be filled with real mechanics, the honest fix is fewer
      levels rather than more flavour -- validate the ~335h curve
      against whatever actually ships.
- [x] **Owner-operator start begins at level 1 (2026-08-09).** It used
      to grant LEVEL_XP[17] (level 18) plus 35 deliveries, 42,000 miles
      and 70,000 dollars of lifetime earnings -- all published to the
      public profile as career history that never happened. The option
      now grants only what it is about: the tractor, 18,000 dollars of
      working capital, and every operating cost. Freight access was
      never the reason for the high level -- all three endorsements
      unlock by level 4.
- [x] **Invariants regen for the tank endorsement and safety record --
      DEPLOYED TO STAGING 2026-08-10** (orinks-net dev `74370b9`). The
      diff was BIGGER than the implementing agents believed: five new
      top-level profile fields, not three. `selection_score` and
      `out_of_service_events` were reported as nested on `DrivingRecord`
      and are not -- they reach `profileFields`, so without this every
      1.9 backup would have failed `invalid_schema` again. Verified both
      directions before deploying (current payloads rejected by the live
      export, accepted by the regen) and confirmed live afterwards by
      uploading a real backup. LESSON: never take "no regeneration
      needed" on trust; diff the export.
      STILL OWED AT THE DEV CUTOVER: the same regen against production.
- [x] **Sound pack repacked for liquid surge -- 2026-08-10.** 274 to 277
      entries; `tests/test_sound_pack.py` pins the length and SHA-256 and
      both were updated. Pushing it needs `git lfs push origin <branch>`
      by absolute path first (git-lfs is not on PATH here), then the
      normal `git push`.
- [x] **The credential ladder SHIPPED (designed 2026-08-15, built
      2026-08-30) -- four tiers from actual CDL structure, the numbers
      verified against eCFR, TSA, and FHWA sources rather than blogs.**
      One `CREDENTIALS` catalog (`ff-core/src/models/credentials.rs`)
      replaced the five parallel endorsement tables; the terminal menu
      is now Licenses and training; courses cost money AND game time;
      grants repeat at the next terminal entry. Buying ahead is bounded
      (owner rule 2026-08-30): a sponsored course books at most ONE
      level before its grant level, so money never skips the ladder --
      the old menu sold the tank course to a level-1 wallet. Per tier:
      TRAINING: `manual_transmission` -- the E restriction removal
      (49 CFR 383.95(c): a skills retest in a manual truck, not a fee)
      paying a 3 percent manual-spec differential on settlements
      driven manual. The transmission SETTING stays freely toggleable;
      the credential only ever adds money, so accessibility is never
      gated behind it.
      CERTIFICATES (carrier training, level-sponsored, buyable early):
      refrigerated 2; NEW `flatbed_securement` 2, which took steel and
      lumber (securement rules are 49 CFR 393 subpart I -- coils get
      their own section); heavy_haul 3 keeps machinery; high_value 4
      keeps packaged chemicals and electronics.
      ENDORSEMENTS (written test; only tank stays level-derived):
      T `doubles_triples` (min level 8, $60 -- knowledge test only per
      383.93(c), not ELDT-covered) unlocking NEW `parcel_doubles`
      nationwide, because STAA twin 28s are legal in every state and
      needed no corridor data; N `tank` (key unchanged, level 16
      kept); H `hazmat` (min level 10, $185 all-in against the real
      $85.25 TSA fee plus theory course) with a 30-game-day background
      check that clears WHILE DRIVING (`pending_credentials` on the
      career, activation at arrival or terminal), unlocking NEW
      `hazardous` placarded freight; X is the derived tank-plus-hazmat
      combination, and `fuel_bulk` now requires both.
      SPECIALIST: `twic` (min 18, $125 -- the widely quoted $125.25 is
      stale, TSA's published fee is $124 -- 20-day wait) gating NEW
      `port_container` drayage out of port, port terminal, and
      intermodal facilities; `lcv` (min 20, $2,000, requires T plus a
      clean recent record via the existing `serious_in_window` window
      -- the 49 CFR 380.203 shape, and LCV is a carrier-held training
      certificate, never a DMV endorsement) gating NEW
      `turnpike_doubles` offered only when BOTH lane endpoints sit in
      ISTEA-freeze states (23 CFR 658 Appendix C list in
      `LCV_STATES`).
      Validator and site: export rows now carry `tier` and OMIT
      `level` for course-only keys -- a missing level compares false
      in the Convex held-check, so even undeployed site code cannot
      level-grant a background-checked credential. Exporter
      regenerated on both sides, byte-parity held. Six new cargo
      badges. New adversarial scenario `credential_ladder_gates`.
- [ ] **Oversize/overweight permit economy (deferred from the
      credential ladder; act three).** Per-state single-trip permits
      (state law, not federal: California $16, Texas $60 plus weight
      fees), pilot cars above roughly 12 to 16 feet of width,
      daylight-only and holiday curfews, and superloads (Texas: over
      254,300 pounds, $375-plus fees, a three-to-four-week route
      study) deepening heavy_haul into a permit economy. `TollEvent`
      is the per-state-charge model to copy. This is also where
      raising GVW above 80,000 pounds on the LCV network belongs --
      today `turnpike_doubles` stays inside the game's legal-weight
      clamp so overweight enforcement stays honest.
- [ ] **LCV corridor fidelity.** The shipped gate checks lane
      ENDPOINTS against the frozen state list; real LCV operation is
      per-corridor (specific turnpikes, break-and-remake yards at the
      state line). When corridor-level LCV data exists, tighten the
      gate from state pairs to the actual turnpike legs.
- [x] **An MCP server inside the real game, so an AI agent can play it --
      landed 2026-08-30 (`freightfate --agent-server`).** Owner call,
      seconded by bscross32's BeamNG experience: connect the agent to the
      GAME, not to a harness -- the harness runs the game's states but not
      its runtime (fake pacer clock, recorded audio, captured speech, no
      real startup path, which is where the deaf-menu bug lives). The
      server rides `run_with_player_input`, the same bounded per-frame
      seam as the autonomous road observer, so an agent gets a player's
      capabilities only: press/hold/release/wait in, and `listen` out --
      BOTH channels of speech through the real verbosity ladder plus
      every earcon, cue, sound bed, horn, radio and engine-pitch move,
      because quiet mode's whole point is that sound carries what speech
      does not. One `observe` inspector (the bounded
      `DrivingObservation`) is labeled ground-truth-not-ears: an agent
      that needs it to drive has found a spoken-surface gap, which is a
      finding. Always in the audited playtest sandbox; speech stays
      audible so the owner can listen to the agent play. Newline JSON-RPC
      on stdio; smoke-tested live (title menu, earcons, menu focus,
      quit), then hardened by the first real agent session, which found
      and fixed four things the same day: the focus-lost wipe silently
      releasing agent-held keys (holds now re-assert every frame), the
      operator's own typing leaking into a focused game window (the
      window now minimizes at launch), a road search running inside the
      game loop's frame (froze the whole game; discovery now runs on the
      serve thread, bounded to thirty nearest corridors -- 0.3 s on a
      release build), and a raw city key spoken in the first-day
      briefing. `start_at` stages a drive at any of the road finder's
      twelve features mid-session, `--agent-server --find FEATURE` boots
      straight into one with no menu ever existing, and `.mcp.json`
      registers the server for Claude Code sessions in this repo. Run it
      on a RELEASE build; debug pays a tenfold search tax. The handshake
      needs no game (fixed 2026-09-01): Claude Code spawns every
      configured server at session start just to list its tools, and the
      first server booted the real game before reading stdin, so enabling
      it launched a game window into every session and held the
      one-game-at-a-time lock against the owner. Now the game boots at the
      first play tool call, a boot refusal (a human already playing) is
      answered rather than fatal, and a client that hangs up quits the
      game instead of orphaning it minimized behind the lock. The same
      day's first two agent drives (Denver deadhead, then Chicago to Gary
      end to end) hardened the tool again: a `press` now lands as a real
      finger tap (key-down one frame, key-up the next -- inside one frame
      the JAWS hold emulation read it as a half-second hold, so a tapped
      brake became the reverse gesture), the session writes
      `logs/agent-session.log` (it never had), the sandbox clears the
      last session's own meaningful-play stamp before the audit (every
      second session refused to boot over it), and a held alert is heard
      once per hold instead of once per frame.
- [ ] **Agent-drive findings, 2026-09-01 (Chicago to Gary, quiet rung,
      metric).** Fixed the same day: the emergency-braking and
      missed-turn paths DISARMED speed control, silently (the truck
      coasted to 5 km/h on open I-90 with "no close traffic ahead") --
      owner ruling: a highway hazard pauses cruise and it resumes when
      clear, and on facility approaches the keeper manages the corners,
      so both now keep the session armed -- and, heard live the same
      evening, the announce-time "Brake!" hazard cancel too: it now pauses
      and the resume path holds off while the hazard is live. The last
      highway cancel followed the same evening: a curve too tight for
      cruise (`trip_events.rs`, the curve branch) now pauses too, with
      the resume keyed to the bend's end -- the chain's end for a linked
      pair -- plus the commit tail (`cruise_resume_after_mi`), so it
      cannot re-engage mid-bend at the old target; the curve call says
      "paused", not "off". Still a disarm, deliberately: the driver's own
      emergency brake, and a hazard that lapses into a collision. "Half a mile of
      ramp" in a metric cab; and, driving a staged bend that evening with
      the owner's own settings, curve speed assistance had NEVER acted for
      him: the curve handler returned at the "curve callouts off" switch
      before the cruise easing, so callouts off silently meant assist off
      too (cruise into a 35 mph bend at 90 km/h, load shifted 31 percent
      over two bends) -- the switch now silences the words and the cue
      only, pinned by two harness tests; the tutorial's timed air reminder (and the school
      lesson's) said "wait for air" after "Air ready", and now says press
      the brake once the gauge is up; the yard access road, a gate and an
      approach zone played the traffic-slowing earcon on entry, so every
      drive opened on it with the engine off -- only a heavy-traffic zone
      earns it now, the rest get the plain notice; and "unpausing replays
      the engine start" was the agent's ears, not the game: the engine
      loop drops silently for the pause menu and comes back silently
      (`stop_world` / the frame's catch-up `engine_start_with(false)`,
      no crank), but the ear tee reported every silent return as
      "[engine] starting" -- it now says "running again, no crank" and
      notes the loop going quiet. Still open, each needing a call or a
      look: (a) FIXED same day: the pacer requeued a cut ROUTE line in
      full after the line that cut it, so every interrupt read as a
      repeat -- "Start on West 14th Avenue" twice, "Out of the gate"
      twice, the state crossing twice in Brandon's log. Owner ruling: a
      line is handed back only when the cut landed in its first half of
      estimated speaking time (`MOSTLY_HEARD_FRACTION` in
      `speech_pacing.rs`, 0.5 as the starting point, testers' ears move
      it); past that it is dropped and the transcript says "[pacer] cut
      line mostly heard, dropped: ..." so a drop that should not have
      happened can be read off a playtest log. A line that had not started
      speaking is still always handed back;
      (b) the "; 1 kilometer" tail on a turn call is the NEXT street's
      length (`surface_distance_tail(leg.miles)`) and lands right after a
      "400 meters" countdown, so it reads as the distance to the turn
      going backwards -- reword to say what it is; (c) at the quiet rung
      the limit change is silenced but each cruise-target step is spoken
      as a bare number ("56." "64." ...), context-free; (d) "unnamed
      public road" is still spoken on Chicago and Gary streets despite
      the 28 August note; (e) FIXED same day: "Current grade 6.0 percent
      downhill" at the flat Chicago Cross-Dock gate was the grade screen
      CLAMPING a read artifact -- every leg into Chicago ends on a +8.6
      percent, 0.4-mile spike because the elevation surface (SRTM) reads
      the Loop's roofs at the city node, 800 feet on 600-foot ground --
      and 6 percent is still a hill in Chicago; the screen
      (`ff-core/src/data/grades.rs`) now REJECTS a slope past the ceiling
      as assumed level wherever both the read HPMS class and the profile's
      own label say level (HPMS Field Manual: level terrain holds short
      grades of 1 to 2 percent; AASHTO Green Book Table 8-1: freeways on
      level terrain design to 3 to 4), and still clamps where the two
      disagree so Wolf Creek and Grants Pass keep their climbs; 119
      segments on 79 legs move, median span 0.3 mile; screened at load,
      bake untouched; (f) the keeper refuses to arm under about 5
      km/h, so a driver stalled at a crawl must throttle first; (g)
      eleven cruise-target steps arrived mid-drive from no agent input --
      only Plus/Minus or a pad D-pad reach that code, so an operator-side
      key or controller may be landing in the minimized game window;
      unresolved.
- [x] **Agent-drive findings, 2026-09-02 (Boston to Worcester, the
      first-day load, standard pacing).** Fixed the same day: the assigned
      load shipped from the very yard the truck was parked in, and the
      board launched a two-mile deadhead from the terminal to the terminal
      (every assigned load did; the pickup now opens in place); the speed
      keeper held the gate zone's 15 into the gate and the miss rule read
      its 15.4 as "too fast" -- four loop-backs on one delivery -- so the
      gate now hands off the keeper with a fresh window and a driver who
      obeyed the pre-gate warning gets a fresh window too; T fifty feet
      short of the gate opened the shoulder-sleep dialog; the paperwork
      quoted the carrier's gross as a company driver's net pay; "Pickup
      ahead" and "Destination ahead" were rescued behind the gate's own
      stop line; two sentence-start fragments. And the agent server grew
      the tools the drive showed it lacked: `pedal` (a bounded hold the
      loop itself releases -- a hold-then-release round trip is a second
      or more, twenty seconds of road at standard pacing, and it overshot
      every limit), `wait_for` (run until a line is heard or a menu opens),
      `select` (a menu row by label), `cruise` (K and the Ctrl dial to a
      number, the posted limit, or off) and `status` (the readouts in one
      call); `observe` now carries speed, the enforced limit and the set
      points. Verified not bugs: coasting "speed gain" after a release
      (round-trip latency under compression), music bed names under the
      wrong weather (pool names; weather only seeds the order), cruise at
      posted plus five (`ACC_LIMIT_OFFSET_MPH`, by design), and the
      handoff burst at a ramp end (the pacer's ROUTE flush rescue,
      designed). The second drive with the new tools (Worcester to
      Providence) took the yard load straight to the shipping office and
      ran the Pike-to-146 corridor on `cruise`, `status` and `wait_for`
      alone, and fixed the tools' first live faults: `wait_for` scanned
      only lines recorded after the call and so missed a menu row spoken
      during the round trip (now anything unreported counts), and the
      dial walked 30 to 55 one mile per hour at a time (fives first when
      the set point is on the grid). Polish heard, not yet fixed: the
      facility type label doubling a name that already carries it
      ("grocery and retail distribution center Providence Grocery
      Distribution Center"), a street spoken with its raw bracketed ref
      ("Madison Street (MA 122)"), and a state-line checkpoint named
      "Rhode Island-Massachusetts line" with MA-146 still the road's name
      on the Rhode Island side.
- [x] **Agent-drive findings, 2026-09-03 (Dallas to Tyler, the Company
      Yard chain).** The pre-gate speed warning fired twice on the streets:
      "gate in half a mile" on South Fannin, four corners before the yard,
      because it still measured twenty-five real seconds of travel with a
      fixed half-mile floor while the gate zone itself had become the
      chain's last street (2026-08-18); then each corner's slowdown obeyed
      it, and the first straight at 30 heard it again inside the zone. The
      window is now the gate zone plus the braking a loaded truck needs
      from its current speed to the gate speed, and the line speaks once
      per approach (`gate_warning_spoken`); obeying it still opens the
      gate's own window at contact. Same drive: route-transition
      assistance, the rev-match and the shift gap all behaved as shipped.
- [ ] **Exit sign text from the wrong carriageway.** Exit 96 on I-90 West
      (Boston to Worcester) is announced as "for I-90 East and Mass Pike
      East toward Framingham, Boston, and Millbury": the bake snapped the
      eastbound junction's `destination` tags onto the westbound leg
      (`legs/MA.json`, corridor interchanges, `at_mi` 38.6). Only Millbury
      is right for a westbound driver; the real sign is I-290 and MA-122
      toward Worcester. Re-sweep exit destination signs with the junction
      node filtered to the leg's own direction of travel, and screen for
      a `via` that names the leg's own highway in the opposite direction
      (a self-contradiction, per the provenance rules).
- [ ] **Real time mode's career clock does not follow the wall clock.**
      A sandbox seeded with `time_scale` 1.0 spoke the computer's time at
      the wheel (9:41, 9:52) while the career's own clock sat hours
      behind, so switching to standard mid-trip arrived "at 10:07 AM"
      after a 2.4-hour trip. `cycle_pace` syncs the calendar only when
      the player switches INTO real time; a career that starts there, or
      a copied settings file, never syncs. Decide whether the career
      calendar should track the wall clock while in real time (and at
      each departure), then make the yard clock and the driving clock one
      clock.
- [ ] **Toll points named for their billing, not their place.** "E-ZPass
      toll point ahead: Massachusetts Turnpike settlement" reads a ledger
      word as a place name, and the Pike has been all-electronic since
      2016 (no ticket settlement). Name toll events for the gantry or
      plaza they stand at, and re-check ticket-system corridors against
      current tolling.
- [x] **Curve speed assistance brakes for the bend on the approach, in
      every driving mode (2026-09-01).** Owner ruling that night, after
      the US-83 drive near Junction, Texas -- every assist on, adaptive
      cruise at 90 km/h into a 35 mph left bend of 197 ft radius, "Sharp
      left: too fast, drifting to the outside", load shifted 12 then 31
      percent over two bends: "assists should handle curves better to
      avoid load/cargo shifting damage." Until then the only proactive
      move was cruise's easing cap; with the pedals in the driver's hands
      or the speed keeper on a street the assist braked only once the
      truck was already inside the bend and over the number. Shipped: a
      curve servo (`driving_updates/curve_servo.rs`) armed by the curve
      call at its lead distance whenever the truck is over the chain's
      tightest advisory -- the arrival assist's own shed profile
      (`(v^2 - t^2) / 2d` net of the road, through `arrival_servo_brake`)
      down to the advisory by the bend's start, held through the chain
      plus the commit tail, released silently; brake by `max`, throttle
      never touched, the driver's own brake cancels it. Cruise above its
      floor keeps the easing cap and the servo stays a backstop (measured
      in the harness: cruise's closing brake takes 60 to 38 in the first
      tenth of a mile and the servo added at most 0.07 of pedal); under
      the floor the pause stays and the servo does the slowing; the speed
      keeper folds the servo's number into its look-ahead so it stops
      pushing. One utterance on the approach -- the pacenote plus "Curve
      speed assistance slowing." (or, under cruise's floor, "Adaptive
      cruise paused for the bend; curve speed assistance slowing, and
      cruise resumes once you are through and back up to speed"); curve
      callouts off says nothing. THE LOAD-SHIFT LINE, from the physics:
      freight moves past 0.40 g of lateral pull, geometric from the
      bend's radius (`CARGO_CORNER_LAT_G`, 12 percent per g-second), and
      the baked advisories sit near 0.30 g, so a load starts moving about
      15 percent over a typical advisory (35 becomes 40) -- and on a bend
      tighter than its sign, like the owner's (0.42 g at 35), the
      advisory itself is the line, which is why the servo aims at the
      advisory with no margin. Six harness drives pin it: cruise, manual
      pedals, the under-floor pause and resume, the driver's brake
      cancelling, callouts off, and the assist off still drifting.
      Follow-up worth a drive: the servo is not persisted, so a save
      mid-approach resumes without it (cruise's cap has the same gap).
- [ ] **Agent playtest probes worth running now the server exists.** A
      spoken-surface navigability probe: an agent at each verbosity rung
      tries to complete a first delivery using ears alone; every place it
      reaches for `observe` is a candidate gap. And a session recorder:
      dump the input trace so a weird agent-found path can be replayed
      and frozen into a break-battery scenario (exploration finds, the
      battery pins).
- [x] **Speech off the game loop -- the general thread-freeze fix
      (Shane's I-77 hang, 2026-08-30).** Every spoken line was a
      synchronous Prism/SAPI call on the main thread; Shane's crash log
      ends on the transcript line written immediately before
      `say_event`, the smoking gun for a wedged backend freezing the
      game permanently. `ThreadedSpeech`
      (`crates/freight-fate/src/speech/threaded.rs`) moves the one
      Prism context to a dedicated worker (built there, never moved --
      the one-context-one-thread invariant holds): the loop queues
      commands in order and never waits, queries answer from a
      worker-published snapshot, refresh/preview wait a bounded two to
      four seconds, a full queue drops new say lines rather than
      growing, and a watchdog logs the wedge once and marks speech
      unavailable until the heartbeat returns. Headless and capture
      test paths unchanged. Worker respawn after a long wedge is the
      recorded follow-up below.
- [x] **Prism 0.18.2 vendored on every platform (2026-09-03).** Up from
      the 0.17.3 wheels: Windows, both Mac slices and both Linux slices
      (RUNPATH repointed to `$ORIGIN` again, now pinned by a test that
      reads the ELF dynamic section, since a raw wheel copy passes every
      other check and boots mute). The ABI only grew: 17 new exports,
      none removed, three new error codes (21..=23) added to `prism-sys`.
      Upstream fixes taken: SAPI plain text tagged not-XML (a leading
      `<` was dropped), Speech Platform voices enumerated, two backends
      at once no longer breaking the NVDA connection, the logger
      teardown crash, exception handling in OneCore. None of them
      describes the owner's "both voices stop mid-drive" report; that is
      the worker-thread case below, and the watchdog line 8 s in is what
      a log from the next episode will show.
- [x] **Speech worker respawn (2026-09-03).** Chris's log settled the
      "Prism crashes, both voices stop" report: NVDA spoke the game's
      last menu line at 18:29:22.4, he pressed Control (the driving
      state's "event voice stopped", a SAPI purge) at 18:29:23.68, the
      worker's last heartbeat is that same frame, and nothing came back
      for the remaining half hour -- including after he restarted NVDA,
      which was never the stuck party. No panic; a native call that
      never returned. Verified against Prism 0.18.2 with two probes
      (`crates/prism/examples/`): a second context on a second thread
      speaks while the first is alive and mid-utterance; `acquire`
      hands the second context the SAME cached SAPI instance (so a
      naive respawn would block on the stuck voice) while
      `registry_create` gives a fresh, idle, usable one; and the
      replacement outlives the abandoned context's shutdown. Shipped:
      after 20 s stale the watchdog abandons the worker, builds one on
      `Speech::new_after_wedge` (a `PrismRegistry::new_fresh` whose
      `acquire` retains one private instance per backend for the worker's
      lifetime, including settings replay and health checks), replays event voice,
      rate/pitch/volume/voice and braille-only in the game's order, and
      logs recovered only after settings replay completes and a voice is
      available; capped at three per session. After abandonment, a returning
      call cannot dispatch more commands or snapshot/health queries. Native
      objects from abandoned workers are retained until process exit, avoiding
      unsafe re-entry during destruction. These recovery corrections follow
      Darren's September 7 logs (2026-09-11); they do not establish the cause
      of his original native stall or reported wider computer lockup. The stop-
      while-speaking probe (150 cycles, with and without NVDA cancel
      and the 3 s re-probe interleaved) does NOT reproduce the hang on
      the owner's machine, so the purge deadlock itself is unfixed and
      voice- or timing-specific; Chris's SAPI voice is worth asking.
- [ ] **Confirm speech recovery on Darren's affected setup.** Retest with his
      NVDA and SAPI voice combination and collect the next session log; the
      deterministic recovery tests cannot reproduce his native stall or prove
      the reported wider computer lockup is resolved.
- [ ] **The frame-time p99 budget test is load-sensitive (found
      2026-08-30, pre-existing).** `frame_time::a_driven_frame_stays_
      well_inside_the_sixty_hertz_budget` fails inside a full
      `cargo test -p freight-fate --test it` run on the dev machine
      (p99 6.7-9.6 ms against the 4.2 ms debug ceiling, median a
      healthy 107 us) and passes comfortably run solo (0.72 s).
      Verified on the untouched branch too -- identical failure -- so
      it is the parallel test binary's load, not a regression. Either
      isolate the bench from sibling test threads or gate the p99
      assertion on an idle-machine check; do NOT loosen the budget.
- [ ] **Jail for a pursuit, not a three-hour "processing" fee.** Owner
      question 2026-08-10, roadmapped rather than built. Speeding is a
      citation even at the extreme end, so no change there -- but fleeing
      police is a genuine arrestable felony, and the game currently
      charges 5,000 dollars, 12 percent damage and 180 minutes of
      "processing" before releasing the driver to the terminal. Three
      hours is booking, not custody. The realistic version holds the
      driver for days of game time, which the "wait out the CDL
      suspension" flow at states/city.py already knows how to advance --
      except automatic rather than chosen. It would also make the
      one-year major-offense disqualification land properly, since the
      driver would come out of custody into a licence they cannot use.
      Must not become a dead end: the notice has to state the release
      date and what still works, per the save_notice cadence.
- [ ] **Give the horn gameplay.** Owner idea 2026-08-10, roadmapped.
      Today it is a sound with no consequence. Real horn use is
      functional and situational: warning a vehicle drifting into your
      lane, alerting someone reversing across your path, the blast at a
      blind corner or an uncontrolled crossing, and the pull-the-cord
      wave to a kid. Mechanically it should be able to PREVENT an
      incident -- a drifting car warned off in time is a collision that
      does not happen, which turns a hazard from a reaction test into a
      decision. It should also cost something when misused: leaning on
      it inside a town is the same municipal noise ordinance the engine
      brake already answers to. The hazard and traffic systems it needs
      both already exist, so this is cheap for how much it adds, and it
      fits the "carrying risk" spine for the back half of the arc.
- [x] **"A live hazard does not survive save and reload" -- CLOSED
      2026-08-11 as not reachable, not fixed.** `_hazard_deadline` is
      genuinely absent from the snapshot, but no save can be written while
      one is running, so there is nothing to save-scum. Every
      player-reachable save needs a parked truck or an open menu (the
      rest-stop save, the motel, a city service with the parking brake
      set), and the one save taken mid-roll is the traffic stop, which
      cannot begin during a hazard: `_begin_pull_over` has a single
      caller, `_begin_observed_stop`, reachable only when
      `_enforcement_busy()` is false, and a live hazard is one of the
      things that makes it true. The scenario reached it by calling
      `snapshot()` directly. Serializing the deadline would be the worse
      bug -- the player would resume on a braking clock they never heard
      the warning for -- so `save_scum_enforcement` now asserts the gate
      instead of the round-trip, and its `KNOWN_OPEN` entry is deleted.
- [ ] **Wear ceilings need their own wall.** The damage bands shipped
      2026-08-09 with a 90 percent out-of-service cutoff, but brake,
      engine, and tire wear at 100 percent still only fade physics --
      no band ladder, no spoken ceiling warning, no "your brakes are
      gone" wall. Verified they are not duplicated by the damage bands;
      this is the natural follow-up.
- [ ] **Senior-driver reassignment on a grounded tractor.** A company
      driver at level 9+ has a dedicated seat and cannot be moved into a
      yard spare without a new persistent Profile field, so they get a
      road-crew patch instead. Given the cloud-validator profile-shape
      history, that field wants its own change.
- [ ] **Cornering damage to the tractor, not just the freight.** A bend
      taken far too fast now costs the load; body damage from cornering
      needs a roll/lateral-load model that does not exist yet.
- [ ] **Reefer spoilage.** Temperature-controlled loads cannot fail
      because no temperature simulation exists to fail; deliberately not
      faked when cargo damage shipped.
- [ ] **A tow, distinct from roadside repair.** The out-of-service
      recovery is a single roadside-repair contract mirroring the fuel
      rescue. A real tow -- where the truck ends up somewhere else and
      the load is affected -- was flagged rather than half-built.
- [ ] **Rename `steering_assist` to `lane_keeping_assist`.** The name is
      inverted: `"off"` means the truck holds the lane FOR you, and
      `"realistic"` is the manual task. Two studies independently flagged
      it as the reason "turns are already manual" reads false. Deferred
      from the turn-commitment pass only because it touches ~40 test call
      sites and would have collided with concurrent work; values map
      `off -> full`, `light -> partial`, `realistic -> off`, and existing
      saves must migrate to today's behaviour, not to a harder game.
- [ ] **Police phases 2-5** (`docs`-less design captured 2026-08-09):
      typed enforcement posts replacing `PatrolWindow` with an observation
      model (geometry, line of sight, weather, traffic cover, severity);
      the full inspection ladder (Levels I/II/V, vehicle out-of-service,
      roadside repair, scale weighing and overweight); staged pursuit with
      a surrender branch and telegraphed spike deployment; urban units
      giving the engine-brake citation a body; ports of entry. Phase 0
      (data + RNG split + pull-over persistence + control hints) and the
      scale data landed 2026-08-09.
- [ ] **Enforcement catch rate is still the weak link.** Fines and the
      violation ladder are tuned per citation, but patrols cover only
      ~4.6% of a 600-mile route in realistic mode, 0% under 120 miles,
      and a 5.5-mile window is 3.8-7.6 REAL seconds at high pacing --
      shorter than `SPEEDING_HOLD_S` (6.0), so at the fastest pacing a
      speeder can be structurally unable to accrue a strike inside a
      patrol. The presence model above is the fix.
- [ ] **Extend the missed-gate overshoot to the pickup and city-service
      gates.** The delivery gate now loops you back when you carry past
      it too fast (2026-08-09, third instance of the scripted loop-back
      pattern); the pickup gate and city-service arrivals still pin the
      odometer at the end regardless of speed — same treadmill, same fix
      pattern, deliberately left out of the first pass.
- [x] **Speak refused backups where the player can hear it.** The manual
      half shipped 2026-08-14 (Shane's report): Save game at the terminal
      now runs the backup immediately (`CloudSaves.backup_now`, no
      debounce or backoff) and speaks the outcome -- accepted, already
      backed up, rejected with the career named, conflict, paused
      sign-in, or still retrying. The background half shipped 2026-08-15
      (owner decision): a background upload's terminal refusal --
      rejected, conflict, or paused sign-in -- now queues one spoken
      line (`CloudSaves.take_announcements`, drained by the app's main
      loop like the controller-disconnect notice), once per cause per
      career until the cause changes or the slot uploads again, with a
      career-named all-clear when backups resume. Transient network
      failures still retry silently; the manual Save game item still
      owns its own attempt's result.
- [ ] **Report client sync status server-side so stalls are diagnosable
      from the dashboard.** The client now logs its per-career sync state
      at startup (2026-08-13), but that only helps for testers who share
      logs; a player whose backups silently stop (Trssharp, Jessie) is
      still a black box. Have the client include a small per-career
      status report with its existing traffic — last upload result,
      recorded conflict and its cloud revision, reason for the last skip
      — stored per driver on orinks-net for the dashboard. Metadata
      only, no save content, riding the existing cloud-backup consent.
      Two-repo change that touches the server, so it waits for the
      validator cutover to settle rather than shipping mid-window.
- [x] **Country-originals music batch (2026-08-08).** Thirty-one tracks
      from the owner's originals zip: five day beds, eight night beds, ten
      country-station songs, the seven-track Nashville After Hours jazz
      station, and a seventh menu milestone bed at level 21. At the time the
      repo shipped `sounds.pak` only (LFS); the loose `assets/sounds` tree
      stayed builder-local and tests fell back to the pack on clean clones.
      The music/ subtree later split into its own `music.pak` with the
      2026-08-14 station-identity batch.
- [x] **Freight Fate stations play everywhere (2026-08-08).** The twelve
      fictional stations plus Nashville After Hours are always available --
      no transmitter bubbles, every mode -- grouped with Roadhouse and
      Night Line on the dial. Reception physics stays covered by fixtures.
- [x] **Live weather immediate and never simulated mid-run (2026-08-08).**
      Station-shared observation cache, city-menu warm-up, first fetch at
      trip construction, and failures hold last-known conditions; simulated
      fallback survives only for a session that was never online.
- [x] **Dead streams hand over instead of going silent (2026-08-08).** A
      stream that refuses to play announces itself off the air, hands over
      within its dial category, and leaves the dial for the session.
- [x] **Dev sync 2026-08-08 (through the 1.8.8 release).** Merged from `dev`:
      activation-code online setup replacing clipboard paste, the one-time
      first-run orinks.net offer (spoken after 1.9's first-day briefing, with
      the city menu's announcement queued so nothing is cut off), corykad's
      transmission and clutch-damage fixes, Day Garwood's save-restore fixes
      (date/season, deadline, and quit-mid-drive saves), live weather that
      follows the truck and reports its freshness honestly, and the pause
      states' move into `driving_pause_states.py` -- carrying 1.9's snow
      chains and carrier repair billing along.
- [x] **Standalone builds no longer die midway on machines without Visual
      Studio (tester report, 2026-08-08).** Nuitka falls back to a downloaded
      MinGW64 GCC there and ran one compiler per CPU core; the parallel
      compilers exhausted memory partway through the ~360-module compile and
      the build failed with a GCC error (elevation never helps -- no build
      step needs admin). `tools/build_release.py` now caps compile jobs to
      one per 2 GB of RAM on such machines and says so; MSVC machines and CI
      keep Nuitka's defaults. Ported to `dev` via PR #151.
- [x] **Rest-stop sleep selection and stopping recovery.** T now plans and
      names the exact nearby sleep stop without silently taking its exit, and
      an independent default-off assist can finish the entrance stop only
      after the player signals and takes that selected exit.
- [x] Add one driving-assistance preset selector with independently adjustable emergency braking, lane, stop-and-go, descent, exit, destination, curve, and route-transition support while preserving player confirmation and control.
- [ ] Add future individual yard-entry guidance and assisted docking; no current preset navigates a yard or completes a delivery.
- [x] **Spoken-message review from the cab (PR #122, Day Garwood).**
      Comma and period walk the message log, Ctrl with either jumps to the
      first or latest, the brackets switch category, and Ctrl+C copies the
      current line. Merged from `dev`; the radio dial moved to semicolon
      and apostrophe to make room, and the app-wide speech repeat now
      stands aside for any state that reviews its own log.
- [ ] Decide whether the app-wide speech repeat and the categorised message
      log should stay two features. They answer the same need with the same
      keys, and only the state flag keeps them apart today.
- [x] **Stop-sign terminals got the bar instruments (playtest
      2026-07-22, third session) -- FIXED same day.** Every bar-position
      instrument (countdown, closing tick, S query, stopped-short
      guidance) was gated to signal terminals; a stop-sign ramp was one
      announce line and then the damage message. All four now answer
      for the sign, with sign-specific wording.
- [x] **Ramp-terminal light folded into route-transition assistance
      (owner direction, 2026-07-22 playtest).** Positioning on the stop
      bar blind under a live light cycle was damage-or-nothing (the
      second playtest ended with cross traffic clipping the trailer on
      a red the driver was still braking for). The assist now brakes
      for red/dying-yellow, holds the stop at the bar until green, and
      caps green crossings under the clean-roll speed; phase speech and
      the pull-ahead stay the driver's. Assist off keeps the fully
      manual bar for the realistic tier.
- [x] **Facility-arrival overshoot trap (playtest 2026-07-22, Gary to
      Chicago) -- FIXED same day.** The gate warnings latched after one
      announcement, so rolling past a pickup, delivery, or city-service
      entrance at speed meant silence for the rest of the drive (six
      minutes and the on-time bonus lost; recovery only found by reading
      the session log). All three gates now re-speak their stop
      instruction every ten seconds while the truck is still moving,
      cancel any re-armed cruise on each repeat, and the S key answers
      with the gate instead of the ended route's posted limit.
- [x] **Route status goes stale after the destination exit (same
      playtest) -- FIXED same day.** R now answers by phase: on the
      street chain it names the current street and the distance to the
      gate; on a scripted approach it drops the highway framing; at
      the gate it says "You have arrived" plus the gate instruction,
      agreeing with the S key. The surface trip also learned the
      facility's name for its fallback cue.
- [x] **Curve speed assistance thrash (same playtest) -- FIXED same
      day.** Engage/release now has hysteresis (engage over advisory +
      5, hold until within 2) and the spoken cues carry a 15-second
      cooldown, so a cruise-vs-curve-brake fight can no longer chant
      slowing/released seven times a second.
- [ ] **Colorado's real traffic and construction are dead (found
      2026-08-26, driving Grand Junction to Delta on US-50).** Every
      fetch logs `invalid JSON: expected value at line 1 column 1` for
      both endpoints, so a Colorado drive gets no real work zones and
      no real incidents. CDOT retired the CARS GraphQL endpoint:
      `POST https://www.cotrip.org/api/graphql` now answers 200 with
      `text/html`, the site's own page shell. This is Colorado alone --
      511in.org and 511mn.org, the other two CARS states, both still
      return `application/json` to the same query, so the platform is
      fine and only this deployment moved. `data.cotrip.org` is live
      and answers in JSON (404 on `/api/graphql`), which looks like
      where CDOT went; the usual CDOT data portal wants an API key, so
      this is a new provider rather than a URL swap. Worth checking
      whether CDOT publishes a WZDx v4 feed first -- the v4 parser
      already exists and would cover the construction half with no key
      and no new parser, leaving only incidents to decide on.
- [x] **Indiana and Wisconsin real-traffic feeds rebuilt -- SHIPPED
      2026-08-09**, with the full-registry sweep. Indiana, Minnesota,
      and Colorado now ride the CARS GraphQL platform
      (`POST /api/graphql`, `MapFeatures` query, incidents +
      construction); Wisconsin and nine more states (AZ, CT, FL, GA,
      ID, NV, NY, NC, PA, UT) read WZDx v4 work-zone feeds at
      `/api/wzdx` -- the old camelCase WZDx parser could not read v4,
      so this fixed every live WZDx state at once. TPIMS truck parking
      rebuilt on Wisconsin's 13 live sites (Ohio's keyless endpoint is
      gone), and the rest-stop parking consumer no longer hardcodes
      Ohio at a fixed coordinate -- the feature is reachable anywhere a
      feed exists. Eleven states stay no_api with dated notes: OH, TX,
      OR, WA (key walls -- could return if the project ever ships API
      keys), CA and TN (dead DNS), MD, MI, MO, NJ, VA (404/403/SPA).
- [x] **Incidents for Florida and New York -- SHIPPED 2026-08-20**,
      the two biggest WZDx-only states. fl511.com and 511ny.org carry
      no incidents on their WZDx feeds, but both serve their own list
      pages from an open DataTables JSON endpoint
      (`POST /List/GetData/Incidents`) with the full incident text,
      and `/map/mapIcons/Incidents` supplies the map-pin coordinates;
      the new `list511` parser joins the two on the event id (verified
      keyless 2026-08-20: FL 22 incidents, NY 105). Work zones stay on
      each state's WZDx feed via a per-state `construction_parser`
      override. Tester demand on record: Brandon singled out the
      Minnesota incident alerts as a favorite and asked for the same
      in more states (2026-08-20).
- [ ] **Incidents for the remaining WZDx-only states.** Nine WZDx
      states (AZ, CT, GA, ID, NV, NC, PA, UT, WI) still get
      construction only. The FL/NY `list511` endpoints are the same
      site platform most of them run; probe each site's
      `/List/GetData/Incidents` and `/map/mapIcons/Incidents` and
      move the live ones over -- likely just registry entries, no
      new parser.
- [x] Cruise vs. curve brake, the deeper fix -- SHIPPED 2026-07-22
      (owner direction, same-day playtest): a pacenote now caps the
      cruise working target to the bend's advisory (like the armed-exit
      ramp cap) and releases silently past the curve footprint, so
      cruise drives the bend instead of fighting the assist brake.
      Manual handoff survives only for advisories under the 20 mph
      cruise floor.
- [x] **Air buzzer once after a shoulder rest -- RULED OUT 2026-08-09.**
      Owner ruling: not worth chasing; the one-off buzzer read as
      unrealistic and the item is closed without a fix. The honest
      low-pressure warnings and the cold-start buzzer-defer stay as
      they are.
- [x] **Cruise sags on a loaded pull instead of revving out (owner
      playtest, night of 2026-07-22) -- FIXED 2026-07-25.** Two causes,
      both confirmed on the bench. The controller was integral-only at
      0.08 per mph-second, so it needed over ten seconds just to reach
      full throttle while the hill was already taking a mile an hour a
      second; it now feed-forwards from `Truck.hold_throttle()`, the
      throttle the truck's own physics says balances the grade under the
      wheels, and only trims from there with P and I (anti-windup, so a
      grade the engine cannot pull does not bury the integrator). And
      the automatic never downshifted, because the revs were not lugging
      yet: `auto_shift` now takes a pull downshift when the pedal is on
      the floor, the road is going up, and the truck is still losing
      ground -- gated on the lower gear genuinely making more wheel
      force, so the box walks down the pull and stops. A loaded 18-tonne
      run at 62 set: a 2 percent climb held 55.7 and never recovered,
      now holds 61; a 4 percent climb bottomed at 33.5, now 43.
- [x] **A climb cruise cannot hold now says so (2026-07-25).** Once the
      pedal is genuinely on the floor and the truck is still more than the
      droop band under its number, cruise says it is flat out and names the
      speed it is holding. Once a hill (a re-arm at half droop plus a two
      minute floor), and terse speech keeps it -- the engine note and the
      downshifts already say the truck is working.
- [x] **Climb cue no longer fires when cruise is winning (dev guards
      ported 2026-07-27, same day as the flag).** `_say_cruise_out_of_truck`
      now carries dev's three guards (f23a97ec): a `CRUISE_GRADE_BEATEN_PCT`
      floor so it never fires on road the G key calls level, a mid-shift
      hold (an open driveline is no evidence either way -- the debounce
      pauses rather than resets, so a shift-heavy climb still gets its cue),
      and a `CRUISE_GRADE_BEATEN_S` debounce so one frame is never enough.
      Cooldown and terse suppression unchanged. Pinned by
      `test_climb_cue_stays_quiet_when_cruise_is_winning` (target jumped
      well above speed on near-level road: silence while accelerating);
      the original repro (`tools/playtest_road.py --find limit-drop
      --cruise 80 --verbosity 2 --headless 6`) runs clean.
- [x] **Predictive cruise (2026-07-25).** Cruise reads `Trip.grade_at` a
      mile and a half ahead -- the baked grade segments resolve to a median
      half a mile, so this is a real road profile, not a smoothed guess --
      and plans against it the way Volvo I-See and Detroit Intelligent
      Powertrain Management do. Banks up to 3 mph before a pull, holds
      rather than reaches in the last 0.4 mile before a crest, and shaves
      up to 2 mph before a downgrade it would only brake away. Read through
      a 0.3-mile window rather than a preview average: averaging buried a
      half-mile 4 percent hill at 1.3 percent and skipped exactly the hills
      banked momentum helps most. Bench, 18 t at 62 set: a 1-mile 4 percent
      pull crests 45.5 instead of 44.3 and takes 4 s less; a half-mile
      6 percent pull averages 49.0 instead of 48.2. Clamped against the
      posted cap, so momentum is never a licence to speed. Setting is
      `predictive_cruise`, on by default, preset-independent like the speed
      keeper.
- [ ] **Eco-coast / neutral roll.** Real AMTs drop the driveline on a
      gentle downgrade (Detroit eCoast, Volvo I-Roll) and let the truck
      roll. Deferred from the 2026-07-25 pass: the fuel model here is pure
      wheel power, so the saving would be real but small, and it lands in
      the engine-audio path that nromey's arc owns. Worth doing when that
      area is next open.
- [x] **Driver-selectable following gap -- SHIPPED 2026-08-19 (owner: "add
      it here for this next test build in 1.9").** Close, normal, far --
      2.5, 3.0, 3.5 seconds (`ACC_GAP_CHOICES`), on a Following gap row in
      Driving assistance.

      Promoted into 1.9 by Darren's citation: he was fined for a following
      distance adaptive cruise was managing and had no way to ask it for more
      room, so the game charged him for a decision it never let him make.

      The driver's choice is a FLOOR -- weather still only ever adds to it,
      so "close" cannot cancel the wet-road opening and "far" cannot be
      quietly pulled back. Every offered gap sits at least a second clear of
      `TAILGATE_GAP_S`, pinned by a test: the closest setting the game offers
      must never be one that gets a driver ticketed for choosing it.

      Not a preset field -- a cushion is a preference, not a difficulty. The
      row speaks its seconds ("close, 2 and a half seconds") because the bare
      word tells a player working by ear nothing about how much road it buys.
      Ontology row added.
- [ ] **I-5 speed limit changes for a few miles (owner observation,
      night of 2026-07-22, verify only).** A short stretch of I-5 spoke
      a different limit. Probably CORRECT -- the dense maxspeed sweep
      baked real posted limits and short zones are exactly what it
      added -- but confirm against the owner's session log which
      stretch it was and check the baked segment against the real
      posted limit there. Verify through a Trip readout, never the raw
      data files.
- [x] **Speeding fine with cruise engaged (Josh report, 2026-07-22) --
      FIXED 2026-07-25; the owner's grade guess was exactly right.**
      Cruise could only cut fuel, and it only ever touched the service
      brake while a lead or a lower posted limit was already pulling the
      target down -- so on a plain downgrade nothing held the truck at
      all. On the bench at 62 set, a 2 percent grade settled nine mph
      over and a 6 percent grade accelerated past 100 with no ceiling;
      on top of the +5 posted offset that is well past the 9 mph strike
      leeway, which is the fine Josh paid. Cruise now stages the
      retarder against the overspeed itself (release, one, two, three,
      on a cooldown so it does not chatter in the player's ears) and
      snubs the service brakes when the jake is not enough. Snubs, not
      the old proportional trim: that settled into a permanent light
      application that drained the tanks 125 psi to 74 in twenty-two
      seconds until the spring brakes set and stopped the truck on a
      downhill. Held speed is now inside about three mph of the set
      speed on grades up to 6 percent, with full air and cool drums.
      Cruise deliberately leaves the retarder alone when it is closing
      on traffic or easing to a lower limit -- the drums do that quietly
      and the jake is loud.
- [x] Add a curated `career_1_9` transcript-backed smoke suite with reusable career-stage presets, structured speech ordering, keyboard reachability, all driving modes, and deterministic event hooks.
- [x] Months-long career arc rebalance: dispatch-assigned fleet tractors by level band (ten new truck models; the roster grew to 35 on 2026-07-25 and dispatch now matches the tractor to the load -- see the slip-seat entry below), a per-level unlock audit so every rank names something concrete, rebalanced XP with re-paced level 21-30 thresholds, 19 new achievements, and a deterministic pacing model (`tools/career_pacing.py`) pinned by tests.
- [x] **Slip-seat dispatch and a 35-tractor roster (2026-07-25).** The
      catalog grew from twelve to thirty-five, spread across day cabs and
      sleepers and light, standard, and heavy driveline specs so there is
      something real for dispatch to choose between. Junior company drivers
      now slip-seat -- what actually happens to a new hire at a big carrier
      -- drawing a tractor per load from a small stable set of yard spares,
      matched to the work: a bunk for anything past 500 miles (eleven hours
      of driving does not cover it), a heavy spec past 20 tons, a day cab
      for a turn inside 250. The pool is deliberately small and stable so
      each spare keeps its own fuel, wear, and damage and the player learns
      which of them pulls; it is also coverage-checked, because the rotation
      alone once left a driver holding nothing but day cabs and sent them
      out on a nine hundred mile run. Levels 1 to 3 stay on the trainer rig
      (onboarding wants one answer), and level 9 ends slip-seating for good
      -- seniority is a truck of your own.
- [x] **Trailer yards and drop-and-hook (2026-07-25).** Trailers are things
      in yards now, not just a type derived from the cargo. High-volume
      facility types stage loaded trailers; a farm elevator or a quarry does
      not, and the middle types are a weighted, facility-stable coin. A
      drop-and-hook pickup is 25 minutes against a live load's 60, and the
      trailer you hook carries its own number and condition -- a rough one
      hands the next roadside inspection a write-up your own walk-around
      would have caught, which is drop-and-hook's real cost. Live loads that
      run past two hours earn detention pay, on the settlement ledger as a
      negative charge (money the other way). Owner-operators pulling their
      own box always live-load, because nobody swaps your trailer for one out
      of the yard. Yards are derived from facility identity and the plan is
      recomputed from the job, so the whole feature persists nothing and
      touches no save schema. Three badges came with it.
- [x] **Drop-and-hook on the delivery end (2026-07-25).** A receiver with a
      drop yard takes the whole trailer: 20 minutes against a live unload's
      45, and it is how a driver sheds a box they have been dragging a defect
      around on. Every dock-worded instruction on the arrival screen now says
      the right thing for the ending it is offering.
- [x] **Pre-trip walk-around (2026-07-25).** Walking the hooked trailer is a
      menu action at the pickup, so the defect is something the driver goes
      and finds rather than something an inspector springs on them at a
      scale -- the accessibility point, since a blind driver had no other way
      to look. Finding one unlocks refusing it: the yard swaps the box for
      `TRAILER_SWAP_MIN`, and the refusal is threaded through the pickup
      snapshot, `start_loaded_drive`, `RouteSelectState`, and the driving
      snapshot so the scale house finds the trailer actually under the truck.
- [x] **Playtest harness reaches the equipment layer (2026-07-25).** The
      harness pressed Enter a fixed number of times at the pickup and arrival
      menus, so every new menu item silently pushed it onto a different
      button; it now selects by label (`select_menu_item`) and handles either
      pickup mode and either delivery ending by name. `PlaytestResult` gained
      the facts a transcript cannot carry -- assigned tractor, the yard spares
      it was drawn from, live load versus drop-and-hook, trailer number,
      condition and defect, detention earned, delivery mode -- and
      `tools/playtest.py` prints them as an equipment block, with
      `--equipment-only` and `--walk-around` for driving the pre-trip.
- [ ] **Harness still cannot reach rest, fuel, the garage, or enforcement.**
      Sleeping, fuelling, repairs, endorsement courses, and roadside
      inspections are all driven by hand in their own tests rather than
      through the harness, so a whole-session playtest cannot cover them.
      Worth a second pass with the same select-by-label approach.
- [ ] **Trailer wear should accumulate, not just be drawn.** A trailer's
      condition is derived from the yard, so nothing the driver does to it
      sticks. Real per-trailer wear wants somewhere to live -- probably the
      same per-truck condition record, keyed by trailer number.
- [ ] Wire Big Buck's content into a playable roadside stop; current 1.9 data and spoken refusal content are shipped, but no honest drive-and-enter gameplay path exists yet.
- [x] **Physics test bench** (`tools/physics_bench.py`): deterministic scripted-driver scenarios over the real truck model -- descents, runaway coasts, stop tests -- printing plain-text, screen-reader-friendly, diffable reports (peak brake temp, fade onset, wear added, the cues the game would have played). The tuning loop for every physics change; `tests/test_physics_bench.py` keeps its orderings honest. Now also a tuning instrument: `--sweep` re-runs a scenario across one knob (speed, cargo, grade, wear) one line per value, and `--solve` bisects for an edge ("the fastest drag speed that stays under fade"), both plain-text and deterministic.
- [x] **Per-truck condition.** Wear, damage, and fuel moved off the profile into `truck_conditions`, keyed by truck, so each owned tractor keeps its own state and swapping trucks no longer teleports condition. Legacy saves migrate (all owned trucks inherit current wear; no pristine spare), per-truck wear is under the save signature, and the field is scoped by truck *model* key -- true per-instance trucks are still the rental feature's job.
- [ ] Truck selling / trade-in at the dealer: no sell path exists today, so `truck_conditions` never needs to drop a record. When selling lands, drop the sold truck's condition record (and decide salvage value from its wear).
- [ ] Transmission as a per-truck purchase spec (rides the dealer/sell path above): a gearbox is bought with the truck, never swapped in later. Carrier-spec company tractors run automatics like real fleets; owner-operators choose at the dealer, and the cheap old rigs of the lease-to-start onramp skew manual -- cheap entry costs shifting skill. Gear count (10/13/18-speed) can join as a spec later. The global Transmission setting survives as the player's accessibility override, and dispatch respects it.
- [ ] **ATS-style in-city facility fronts (community ask via Josh, 2026-07-21).** A player asked for "city services like in American Truck Simulator" -- the drivable in-city facility buildings: truck dealer, service shop, purchasable home garage, recruitment agency, truck wash. Nearly all of it maps onto features already planned here (dealer/sell path and transmission spec above; player truck marketplace; multi-truck logistics with a per-truck home city; the AI driver fleet IS the recruitment agency; truck-stop repair bays shipped). Recommended shape, relayed to the owner for Josh: do NOT hard-gate the district to owner-operators -- facilities answer honestly by role instead. A company driver browses the dealer (window-shopping is the aspiration loop, and the lease-to-start onramp is the dealer's answer to a broke driver), repairs stay carrier-billed at terminals, and only the recruitment agency waits naturally on owner-operator status plus a second truck. Physical access rides the facility-approach machinery: each facility is an endpoint on a baked surface-street chain, the same way docks and errand destinations connect today -- also the answer to "how do we connect parking to the surface streets": mint the spot as an endpoint in the same bake. Note the naming collision: Freight Fate's existing "city services" are the in-town errand drives, a different feature.
- [x] **Jake brake realism.** The jake is now retarding torque through the gearing -- three stages, scaling with RPM and gear ratio -- so gear discipline decides descents: stage 3 in 7th holds a loaded rig on a 6 percent grade with zero service brake, stage 1 makes the shoes work, and overdrive gives almost nothing. Automatics pre-select down into the retard band with the jake on and upshift past the RPM ceiling to protect the engine (the realistic runaway spiral). Bench-solved anchors: jake-only holds up to ~26 tonnes of payload on the 6 percent; past that you snub or run away. The on/off key still works; a staged in-cab control is open follow-up below.
- [x] **Brake thermal realism.** Drum heat is now real energy accounting: dissipated brake power soaks a drum thermal mass, cooling is convective (square root of speed -- outrunning your brakes no longer air-conditions them), and faded shoes grip less so they also heat less. The six-mile 6 percent drag now peaks at 466 C with miles ridden past fade, while jake-and-snub finishes cool -- the drag-vs-snub lesson finally has teeth. Overspeed realism came with it: the road can drive the engine past the governor (that wears it; governed running is safe), and brake wear is now charged per megajoule actually dissipated in the shoes.
- [x] Staged jake in-cab control (landed 2026-07-21, owner control scheme): J is the dash enable switch and re-engages at the last-selected stage; 1/2/3 select two/four/six cylinders while the jake is on (spoken), and do nothing while it is off so the number keys stay free for other contexts. Controller: modifier + jake button cycles stages. Automatic descent control still manages the full jake itself.
- [x] **Traction deep-dive: freezing rain, hydroplaning, jake grip cap.** `WeatherKind.ICE` (grip 0.15, a third of snow) forms physically -- rain sampled in the 1 to -4 C band glazes, and the live NWS feed maps freezing rain/sleet/ice to it instead of snow -- with its own hazards, spoken "ice on the road" status, and a bench `stop-ice` anchor (880 ft from 40 mph vs 329 dry from 60). Hydroplaning follows the Horne relation: onset ~106 mph on fresh tread (trucks at highway pressure basically never plane), pulled down by tread wear and standing-water depth (`WeatherEffects.water_mm` -> `truck.water_mm`) -- 80 percent worn rubber planes at ~59 in heavy rain, grip collapsing toward a 0.3 floor over a 12 mph band, with a spoken onset warning and hydro-aware conditions incidents. The jake is now capped by drive-axle grip (42.5 percent of gross, half usable before lockup): dry never binds, glare ice breaks stage 3 loose in a low gear while stage 1 stays hooked up, `jake_slipping` speaks a warning, and the bench `grade-jake-ice` run shows the capped jake losing ground on a 4 percent it would hold dry.
- [ ] Jake-slip and hydroplane consequences beyond the warning: sustained sliding should be able to escalate into a real incident (trolley jackknife / spin) through the event system, which needs a "release the jake / ease off" resolution verb rather than the brake-to-answer hazard contract.
- [ ] **Curve management as a difficulty tier (owner idea 2026-07-15;
      sound grammar designed 2026-07-16).** The data half is DONE: 63,725
      discrete curve records (at-mile, direction, radius, physics
      advisory speed) are baked and shipped under world_data/us/gameplay.
      The feature: at the manage-curves difficulty tier speak the
      approach ("sharp right, quarter mile, advisory 25" -- plain
      language pacenotes from the real records, warned in REAL reaction
      seconds like ramp endings), guide the bend, require the slowdown,
      and let hot entries pay physics consequences (drift off-lane, load
      and ice against the lateral-traction bullet above). SOUND GRAMMAR
      (owner + Fable design session 2026-07-16, Forza Motorsport's Blind
      Driving Assists as validated prior art): silence-is-centered on
      straights -- the lane speaks only when you drift (fatigue beats
      information density over a ten-hour haul); when the road bends,
      the PURSUIT guide takes over -- pan the existing road/engine bed
      along the arc (Forza's steering guide panned engine+tires toward
      the needed steer; pursuit tracking beats error-nulling in the
      human-factors literature -- the owner independently reinvented it
      from bed); drift cues stay underneath as the error backstop; lane
      EDGES get per-side textures (rumble strip inside vs gravel
      shoulder outside) so single-sided hearing still knows which way it
      wandered; and every cue gets a preview-in-Settings audition, Forza
      style -- a natural driving-school lesson. Steering input, presets
      (Josh's DRIVING_ASSIST_FIELDS entry, keyboard first-class, analog
      pad.steering as the smoother option), and the exact guide sound
      NARROWING: Josh passed on the audio-design lead (2026-07-16), the
      owner posted the open questions to the audiogames.net forum
      (posted 2026-07-17 in the Freight Fate thread, replies same day),
      and the community RESOLVED two of them our way: NO steering
      tones (JaceK: continuous tones overwhelm the soundscape and hurt
      players with sensory/hearing issues; rumble strips and real-world
      edge sounds instead -- exactly the silence-is-centered +
      per-side-textures design, owner concurs and had already resolved
      on rumble strips), and the guide stays the panned existing bed,
      never a new tone. JaceK also ruled: BRAKE BEFORE THE BEND, never
      in it (locked wheels lose steering) -- pacenotes must front-load
      the slow-down call, and mid-curve braking should cost grip in the
      physics. Still open: steering-input feel (his "thinking ahead,
      not jerking the wheel" leans hold-to-sweep).
      PACENOTE LAYER SHIPPED (2026-07-18): data/curves.py reads the
      shard (143 ms once, cached), Trip carries route-mapped
      direction-mirrored curves, and DrivingPacenoteMixin speaks the
      calls -- severity from the baked advisory (hairpin <=25 / sharp
      <=35 / curve <=50 / gentle bend), front-loaded lead (5 s reaction
      + comfortable-braking distance, floor a third of a mile), silent
      when already slow enough, linked "then right" tails, U lists the
      next bends, D folds the bend into its number, Settings toggle
      outside presets. PURSUIT GUIDE + EDGE LADDER SHIPPED (2026-07-27,
      Track B): the road bed pans along the arc toward the needed steer
      (community ruling honored -- the existing bed, never a new tone;
      silence-is-centered with drift/curve wake-sleep hysteresis), and
      the lane edges answer with structural textures synthesized from
      the edge_nav audition machinery -- intermittent clip / periodic
      strip / aperiodic gravel, panned to the side, with boundary truth
      from the baked lane data (no gravel past an undivided centerline;
      the spoken warning names the oncoming lane; graded haptics
      unchanged). Turn signals now speak as panned tones (owner call
      2026-07-27); the relay click stays for a future vintage-equipment
      option. Remaining slices: the required-slowdown consequence tier
      (hot entries pay physics), steering-input feel, cue previews.
- [x] **Real lane counts from OSM (owner ask 2026-07-16) -- DATA LAYER
      BAKED 2026-07-23.** `corridor.lane_segments` now carries real OSM
      lane counts (`lanes`, `lanes:forward`/`backward`, `oneway`) for every
      leg OSM tags, matched to the archived route geometry against the
      self-hosted Overpass -- the exact way-matching pattern of the dense
      maxspeed sweep (`tools/bake_lane_segments.py`, reusing the Job 2
      matcher). Honest absence where OSM has no tag (no guessed defaults);
      the runtime can default by road class later. All 1,287 legs swept,
      20,666 segments, 96.3% of route-miles covered (per-state 92-99%,
      reported in `logs/oatis-lane-bake-done.json`); acceptance verified --
      I-40 widens to 3+ lanes through Albuquerque and holds 2 rural.
      Guarded by `tests/test_lane_data.py`. No mechanic reads it yet: the
      wiring job below carries the player-facing changelog.
- [x] **Lane counts spoken (Track D multilane slice) -- SHIPPED
      2026-07-27.** The baked `corridor.lane_segments` now reach the player
      as speech: the road-status readout and the route briefing say the
      lanes in the travel direction ("divided, three lanes your side"),
      and a callout fires when the count changes mid-leg ("road widens to
      three lanes", "down to two lanes your side"). Direction-aware (your
      side flips with travel direction), verbosity-aware (change callouts
      hush in terse; status readout keeps them), and honest-absence (legs
      with no baked lane data say nothing). Runs shorter than two miles
      collapse so a passing-lane blip is not announced. Speech only -- no
      traffic, no lane-position mechanic. `tests/test_multilane_speech.py`.
- [x] **Divided-highway flag baked (Track D2, for curve nav) -- SHIPPED
      2026-07-27.** Each leg carries `divided: true/false` from real OSM
      carriageway geometry (`tools/bake_divided.py`, PBF cache, oneway
      pairing), so curve nav's LEFT edge can sound like a median on a
      divided highway vs the centerline with oncoming traffic on an
      undivided one -- instead of inferring it from road class. 1005
      divided, 196 undivided, 86 genuinely-mixed legs omitted (honest
      absence, inference stays the fallback). Data only; curve nav reads
      it. `tests/test_divided_data.py`.
- [ ] **Lane data as a mechanic (Track B / 2.0, follows the speech
      above).** REAL LANE DROPS as genuine merge events tied to lateral
      position, real widths enforced, exit-lane guidance, and keep-right
      pressure that knows how many lanes exist. Reads the same
      `corridor.lane_segments`; advisory guidance may run on partial data,
      punitive consequences only where lane data is real (see
      `docs/lanes-harvest-brief.md`). Lateral position belongs to the
      curve-navigation track.
- [ ] **Assistance-mode assessment: accessibility features that drive the
      truck right (Josh's ask to the owner, 2026-07-22).** The automatic
      driving aids -- adaptive cruise, the speed keeper, curve speed
      assist, route-transition assist, descent control, automatic
      emergency braking, lane keeping -- are ACCESSIBILITY features, not
      truck-spec upgrades: they exist for players who need them and stay
      available on every truck regardless of the era/spec ladder (the
      same override rule as the transmission setting). Their duty is to
      operate the real truck the way a skilled driver would: engine
      brake before service brakes, traction-linked, honest air and wear
      costs, audible through the proper voices (jake growl versus brake
      clunk) so a blind driver can hear WHICH system is acting. Curve
      speed assist got jake-first on 2026-07-22; the keeper, transition
      assist, descent-control interactive mode, and AEB still go
      straight to the pedal. Owner to assess each mode in play and call
      the fixes; auto jake and the traction-linked retarder gate are the
      building blocks.
- [ ] **Hand throttle, parked high-idle, and equipment by model era
      (owner idea 2026-07-22, sparked by the 896 take's rev-and-hold).**
      Two features on the per-truck-spec pattern. (1) PARKED HIGH-IDLE
      -- SHIPPED 2026-07-22 (sound/engine-integration): K latches it
      while the parking brake holds (controller: Y), plus/minus step
      the setpoint 800-1500, air genuinely builds faster, parked
      revving burns real fuel, and releasing the brake cancels it like
      a real ECM. (2) EQUIPMENT BY ERA:
      cruise control only exists on electronic engines (~1990-on), so a
      genuinely vintage mechanical rig -- marketplace/classic material,
      the 896 Mack's era -- gets NO cruise, a HAND THROTTLE that also
      holds rolling (throttle, not speed: rpm sags audibly on grades),
      manual box only, and NO ABS (pre-1997), which couples straight
      into the traction physics. Lease-fleet "old" trucks (2000s-2010s)
      keep cruise and ABS but not adaptive extras. Same accessibility
      rule as the gearbox spec: realism default per truck, Settings
      override stays. On-road hand throttle must cancel instantly on
      brake, like cruise. AUTO JAKE SHIPPED 2026-07-22 for automatic
      boxes (J = auto retarder management, Volvo off/auto/1/2/3 stalk;
      Alt+J for hand-stagers, Alt+T flips shift modes on the road) --
      when the era ladder lands, vintage rigs simply lack the auto
      position. Follow-up worth doing: true AMT manual-hold mode (pin a
      gear without the clutch, like a real AMT's arrows) -- pairs with
      driving-school descent lessons.
- [ ] **A turn signal you actually operate (owner idea 2026-07-16).**
      Today lane-change taps click the signal for you; give the player
      the stalk: signal before a lane change, and unsignaled changes
      become a discipline the CB and troopers can notice at the
      higher-realism tiers. Pairs with a LANE-LINE CROSSING sound --
      a soft paint-and-dots tick when crossing a dashed line, the
      clearly-quieter kin of the edge rumble strip, so every lane change
      has a physical moment (owner idea, same night).
- [ ] **Signal-and-steer turns on surface streets (owner idea
      2026-07-15).** Turn-by-turn today is automatic: the truck follows
      the baked chain, the player hears the cue and panned chime and only
      manages speed and stops. At the higher-realism tier a turn should
      be driven: signal (indicator stalk sound already shipped), brake to
      turn speed, steer through with the same guidance-tone grammar as
      curves, with missed or unsignaled turns costing a reroute or
      strike. Natural interaction layer for per-turn trailer
      off-tracking.
- [x] **Map sharding: split the two 60 MB JSON files before GitHub's
      100 MB wall (Josh's ask, 2026-07-18; SHIPPED 2026-07-19).** Both
      trees are now per-state shards keyed on the state a leg starts in:
      the source moved from world.json to world_source/ (meta.json,
      cities.json, legs/TX.json ...) and world_data/us/legs.json became
      world_data/us/legs/. Largest shard is Texas at 5.4 MB, down from
      60 MB. tools/world_source.py hands every build tool the same merged
      dict it always got (load_world / save_world), so ~25 tools migrated
      mechanically and none changed behavior; save_world rewrites only
      the shards that actually changed, so a one-leg edit is a one-file
      diff. index_world.py emits the runtime shards and its --check now
      also catches a stale shard left behind after its last leg moved
      states. No git-lfs (breaks plain clones, costs Josh quotas), no
      history rewrite (Josh's call, someday) -- the 341 MB pack stays.
- [x] **Truck-accessibility sweep: vehicle_access classification
      (Josh's spec via Codex, owner + Phil concur, 2026-07-18).** Full
      brief: docs/truck-access-sweep-brief.md. Three tiers on every
      stop, separate from parking: tractor_trailer (announced, usable),
      bobtail_only (on the map, hidden from semi announcements and HOS
      planning; usable in 1.9 while GENUINELY bobtailing -- an empty
      trailer is not a bobtail), none (landmark only). Never filter by
      brand (some Exxons and the Wawa Travel Center are truck-oriented;
      1,082 generic fuel_station records need real classification, not
      a brand purge); generic fuel stations default bobtail_only unless
      truck access is verified via OSM/Overpass. Route gaps left by the
      sweep get filled with REAL truck stops, plazas, and rest areas --
      never disguised gas stations. The parking buff may affect
      fullness at legal stops, never admit semis to impossible lots.
      Policy bans (Big Buck's GOLDEN ANTLER waiver) stay a separate
      future flag; the pass never overrides physics. OATIS runs the
      sweep in his own window AFTER sharding lands; the
      announcement/HOS filter is game-side. SHIPPED 2026-07-19: rails
      game-side (b91d476, every stop defaults tractor_trailer), sweep
      merged from map/truck-access-sweep -- all 3,745 stops classified
      (2,720 tractor_trailer / 1,021 bobtail_only / 4 owner-adjudicated
      none), 527 real gap-fill facilities on 248 legs, 100-mile-plus
      service gaps roughly halved (sleep 271 -> 136). Follow-ups live
      as their own bullets below (locators, warn-at-dispatch, sampling
      density, classify-at-creation); 81 legs remain UNVERIFIED where
      OSM is likely under-tagged rather than the corridor truly empty.
- [ ] **Terrain audit: relief-aware reclassification (player-found by
      Josh, 2026-07-19).** The grade-segment classifier calls any
      segment over 3% "mountain" with no relief context, so East Texas
      creek dips read "terrain mountain" and can roll mountain-only
      hazards (runaway truck) outside Lufkin; meanwhile 186 legs with
      mountain-scale relief are labeled flat at leg level (the
      Grapevine!). Physics is untouched (it reads numeric grades).
      Full brief with rules, ground-truth checks (all 96 runaway ramps
      must sit on mountain segments), and the handshake:
      docs/terrain-audit-brief.md. Oatis's next map job after the
      access sweep merges.
- [x] **Name the villages a leg passes through (landed 2026-07-20).**
      Swept and spoken: "Entering Strawberry" arrives just before the
      35 it explains, on every leg that has such a town. Governed by
      the Place callouts ladder (see the map workstream section for
      the bake details and the ladder design).
- [ ] **Guard the real world source during tests.** save_world()
      defaults to the checked-in source, so a stray call from a test or
      ad-hoc script silently rewrites the map (same class as the
      FREIGHT_FATE_DATA_DIR rule for saves). Add a loud failure when
      tests write the real source without explicitly opting in.
- [ ] **Toll sweep: every leg, real published rates, and a transponder to
      buy (owner, 2026-07-19).** The map prices 46 toll events across 16
      authorities -- broad coverage of the tolled interstates, since those
      are the only toll roads the router uses (I-4, I-35, I-10, I-25 and
      friends are free; SH-130, Florida's Turnpike and E-470 are
      alternatives we never route onto). Two gaps, both real:
      every amount is `estimated: true` -- plausible, never sourced to a
      published tariff -- and some tolled legs carry nothing at all
      (New Hampshire's I-95 Hampton plaza, and the Portsmouth->Portland leg
      that crosses the Maine Turnpike's York barrier we toll elsewhere).
      `tools/toll_scan.py` finds the rest by evidence: it walks each leg's
      geometry and asks OpenStreetMap what carries `toll=yes`, classifying
      a sighting as ON-ROUTE only when the tolled way's own `ref` names the
      leg's highway. Proximity is not use -- I-30 runs within two miles of
      the George Bush Turnpike and a truck on I-30 pays neither, so a
      parallel tollway is reported for review and never billed.
      Then price the confirmed set against each authority's published
      5-axle commercial tariff, storing BOTH the transponder and the
      pay-by-plate amount per event.
      **The transponder mechanic that pays for:** company drivers get one
      from the carrier (the toll model already assumes settlement
      accounting, so nothing changes for them); an owner-operator buys a
      generic "toll transponder" ONCE, or pays plate rates at every gantry
      until they do. A single device rather than E-ZPass plus K-TAG plus
      PikePass plus SunPass: real national drivers carry several, but
      modelling five networks is buying the same decision five times --
      tedium, not depth. The trade-off survives the compression, since
      skipping it still costs real money every mile of turnpike.
      Note for the pricing pass: `$0.00` events are NOT bugs. They are the
      documented ticket-system entry markers (see `docs/route-stop-data.md`)
      that settle at the exit gantry.
      **State 2026-07-21: groundwork landed, data NOT yet baked.** The old
      46 estimated events are gone; the world currently carries ZERO toll
      events, only per-leg `tollway_detected` scan flags. `tools/toll_scan.py`
      (evidence scanner), `tools/toll_rates.py` (the researched 5-axle
      tariff table), and `tools/toll_review_sheet.py` all shipped in
      fcd846a; the remaining work is reviewing the sheet and running the
      bake. Until then the game bills no tolls at all -- upstream's
      "prices seem off" report (Josh, 2026-07-21) is right on both lines.
- [ ] **Interactive toll plazas: stop, window down, pay cash (Josh ask,
      owner approved, 2026-07-21).** Real toll points split two ways and
      the bake should record which is which per event: all-electronic
      gantries have nothing to stop at -- no transponder there means
      pay-by-plate at the higher stored rate, spoken honestly as you pass
      -- while conventional plazas with cash lanes get the mechanic: an
      approach call ("Toll plaza ahead, cash lanes right"), X to take the
      cash lane (the same verb as exits and pull-overs), then the ramp
      stop-bar machinery runs the booth -- rolling countdown, the
      parking-sensor tick to the window, stop, window down, the spoken
      amount, pay, barrier, go. Costs real clock time versus the
      transponder lane. Rides the stoppable-stop spine with chain-up
      areas and Big Buck's; per-operator cash acceptance is researchable
      in the same pass that bakes the tariffs. Josh's in-progress traffic
      and API work could someday feed cash-lane queue lengths as an
      optional live layer (determinism boundary applies).
- [ ] **More first-party truck-stop locators, and public parking feeds
      (owner approved, 2026-07-19).** `curate_route_pois.py` queries only
      Love's and Pilot/Flying J today (730 + 877 locations). Pointed at the
      21 legs with no truck-accessible stop, those two closed exactly one
      (Pilot Dealer Perris, I-15 mile 88) -- useful, and evidence the
      corridors really are thin rather than merely untagged. Add the chains
      we never ask: **TA/Petro** (the big omission), Sapp Bros, Bosselman,
      Road Ranger, Maverik, plus the **AmBest** and **NATSO** member
      directories, which is where the rural independents live. Same code
      path, same `Candidate` shape, same citable source notes.
      **TA/Petro specifically is LOW PRIORITY, and here is why so nobody
      re-derives it:** Love's + Pilot gave 1,607 real first-party locations
      and produced exactly ONE hit across the 20 legs. TA is ~360 locations
      with the same Interstate-heavy profile, so expected yield is ~0-1. The
      structural reason is that national chains build where freight density
      is -- on Interstates -- and every remaining gap leg is a US or state
      route. No chain locator can close them, by definition. Checked
      2026-07-19: TA's sitemap lists 361 location pages and robots.txt
      permits crawling them, but the JSON-LD is EMPTY (lat/lon/address
      render client-side) and the official API needs a partner token, so it
      costs a JS renderer or a business relationship for near-zero return.
      Also investigate **Park My Truck** (NATSO/ATRI) for a DOCUMENTED public
      feed -- real-time space counts, publicly funded origins.
      DO NOT scrape Trucker Path, AllStays, or similar apps: the data is
      their product, their terms forbid it, it is not licensed for
      redistribution, and user-reported availability cannot go in a
      deterministic offline game that must answer every player identically
      forever.
- [ ] **"Where am I": an on-demand orientation key (owner, 2026-07-19).**
      A sighted driver answers this with a glance at a sign. A blind driver
      cannot, and no amount of automatic chatter answers it at the moment
      somebody actually wonders. It joins the existing on-demand family (S
      speed, D details, U upcoming, X exit), so the pattern is already
      familiar. Speaks what the map already knows and currently keeps to
      itself: nearest town and its distance and direction ("Pine, one mile
      ahead; Strawberry, four back"), the road and state, the nearest baked
      landmark, the next route city.
      **Nearest truck service belongs here too, and MUST honour
      `vehicle_access`** -- naming a bobtail-only stop as "nearest service"
      to a driver pulling a trailer is exactly the false promise the
      truck-access sweep just removed from announcements.
      This also reframes the village sweep: the bake becomes the DATA LAYER
      this key reads, and the automatic half stops being a separate callout
      at all. The town name RIDES the limit announcement the game already
      makes -- "Entering Strawberry. Speed limit drops to 35." -- so it adds
      no new event, only the context that stops the drop reading as
      arbitrary. That is why it belongs ON by default (owner's call, and the
      right one): defaulting it off would suppress the explanation for
      something the game announces regardless. The toggle stays for anyone
      who wants the bare limit call.
      Push and pull answer different questions and neither substitutes for
      the other: the ride-along answers "why is this happening", the key
      answers "where am I on I-40 at three in the morning", which never
      arrives on a schedule.
      **Bake WIDE, display TIGHT.** The 0.5 mi rule is what makes "entering"
      true, but the key's honest answer is whatever is nearest at whatever
      distance -- on I-40 that may be "Winslow, eleven miles ahead", and
      refusing to say it would make the key useless exactly where it is
      wanted. So collect a 10-15 mi catchment, store each place's offset and
      whether it is on-route, and let the tight radius govern the callout
      only. Two or three places at most, along-the-road direction rather
      than compass.
      **Low priority and interruptible (owner, safety).** Speak it with
      `interrupt=False` so it never purges anything; the existing safety
      path then preempts it for free, since an interrupting line already
      purges the channel. Keep it short -- a long recital holds the channel
      long enough that even correct preemption feels laggy.
      **Big Buck's stays hidden.** A readout that gives its distance hands
      away the discovery. Let the key speak it only after the player has
      found one, or surface it as CB rumour -- the button reports what the
      driver would plausibly KNOW, not what the database contains. That
      rule keeps it an orientation aid rather than an oracle.
- [ ] **Warn the driver before an under-served route, instead of faking a
      stop on it (owner, 2026-07-19).** After the access sweep, 21 legs over
      100 miles carry no stop a combination vehicle can enter. Designating an
      invented truck stop would falsify real geography -- a 158-mile US-2
      Hi-Line stretch with nowhere to pull in is TRUE, and US-50 across Nevada
      is meant to be empty. So surface the constraint rather than paper over
      it: at dispatch and route selection, warn when (a) the calculated fuel
      range will not clear the route's longest stretch with no truck-accessible
      fuel, or (b) HOS says a sleep falls due inside a stretch with no
      truck-accessible sleep stop. Turns a data gap into the planning tension
      the game is about -- and it is honest where an invented stop is not.
      The gap maths already exists in tools/truck_access_gap_report.py
      (longest serviceless stretch per leg per capability) and wants moving
      into the sim beside the HOS planner. Note the evidence limit: on I-15
      San Diego-Riverside and I-69 Bloomington-Evansville a dense 5-mile probe
      found 53 and 19 named stations with ZERO truck tags of any kind, so
      "no verified stop" cannot be read as "no stop exists" -- another reason
      to warn rather than assert.
- [ ] **Densify corridor POI sampling in the mapping utility (found
      during the access sweep, 2026-07-19).** `_overpass_named_candidates`
      queries a fixed 7 boxes per leg -- five mid-corridor samples plus the
      two endpoint cities -- each about 7.5 miles of road. That is ~52 miles
      inspected regardless of leg length: a third of a 162-mile leg, a
      seventh of a 345-mile one, so coverage is thinnest exactly where a
      serviceless stretch strands somebody. The five mid-points are indices
      into `route_points`, not evenly spaced miles, so they cluster wherever
      geometry vertices fall; the Love's at Williams and the truck stops at
      Corning sit in the blind spots on I-5, both `hgv=yes` in the extract we
      already query. Generic car fuel (the `rural_fallback` relaxation) hid
      this by making thin corridors look served until the access sweep
      demoted them. Fix belongs in the enrichment tool: sample by mileage and
      scale the probe count to leg length.
      `tools/fill_truck_access_gaps.py` densifies only INSIDE qualifying
      gaps, so corridors that are merely thin are still under-sampled and a
      map-wide re-sweep is still owed.
- [ ] **Emit `vehicle_access` when the mapping utility creates a stop
      (owner, 2026-07-19).** Every POI-adding path should classify at
      creation instead of waiting for a re-sweep, or each map expansion
      reintroduces unclassified stops. When judging an unfamiliar operator,
      read the OSM `website` tag -- it often carries the operator's own
      location page, which settles format and amenities better than a brand
      name (it identified Love's #120 as a Vian country store). That matters
      most for Hawaii, Alaska, and Canada, where the chains are unfamiliar.
- [ ] **Real construction zones from state 511 APIs.** When real-time
      traffic is enabled, construction zones should be generated from actual
      state DOT work zone data instead of simulated zones. Requires:
      parsing construction events from 511 APIs, mapping real construction
      locations to route mile markers, converting real data into Zone objects
      with appropriate speed limits, and fallback to simulated zones when
      real data is unavailable. The current implementation only announces
      construction as traffic alerts; this would make the zones themselves
      match real-world work zones.
- [x] **No-key realism enhancements -- SHIPPED 2026-07-16.** Four foundational
      realism systems added without API keys: enhanced truck stop amenities
      (CAT scales, laundry, game rooms, barber shops, premium wifi, check
      cashing, DEF lanes, ATM services), truck stop loyalty programs (points
      per gallon, shower credits, reward redemption), real-time traffic data
      via state 511 APIs (Ohio OHGO as reference), and truck parking
      availability via TPIMS APIs (Ohio OHGO as reference). All three
      real-data systems are optional settings with graceful fallback to
      simulated data. Amenities are data-only; loyalty is fully playable;
      traffic and parking are integrated as announcements and availability
      checks. (2026-07-22: the incident-alert path had never actually run --
      it crashed on a missing Trip helper and queried a hardcoded Ohio
      point; fixed on the 1.9 line to use the truck's real state and
      position, checked once per mile.)
- [ ] **Route terrain browser (owner idea 2026-07-15).** A reviewable,
      navigable summary of what the route will demand: big climbs and
      descents with grade and length, sharp-curve clusters, chain-law
      areas, by milepost -- readable at dispatch and route selection,
      from the pause menu, and on demand while driving alongside the U
      upcoming key. Feeds off corridor.grade_segments and the future
      curve records; kin to the map-stats explorer idea.
- [x] **On-demand safe-speed key -- SHIPPED 2026-07-15.** D (next to S's
      posted limit, a deliberate spatial pair) speaks one number: the
      minimum of the posted limit, the weather-grip safe speed, and the
      ramp speed once an exit is armed within two miles or the truck is on
      the ramp. Weather and context are baked into the math, never the
      sentence ("Safe speed 45 miles per hour for the ramp."), repeatable
      free. Curve advisories join the same key when the Job 2 curve
      records land (the curve-tier bullet above).
- [x] **Speech history review -- SHIPPED 2026-07-15.** Comma now walks
      back through a ring of the last 20 spoken lines across both
      channels: first press repeats the newest (unchanged), further
      presses within ten seconds each step one line older, spoken with a
      "2 back:" position prefix, clamped at the oldest -- the
      speech-history pattern NVDA users already know. A fresh
      announcement (or a pause past the window) resets the walk to
      newest; consecutive duplicate lines collapse to one entry. A keeps
      its route-announcement meaning unchanged. The event pacer also
      logs a `[pacer]` transcript marker whenever it flushes a stale
      backlog, so playtest logs show the flushes.
- [x] **Stale event-speech backlog -- FIXED 2026-07-15.** The event voice
      queued utterances faster than it spoke them, so arriving at the yard
      played the whole approach script late ("slow down to dock, at dock,
      delivering" after the load was dropped) and the backlog talked over
      light dings. `EventSpeechPacer` (speech.py) now projects when the
      channel falls silent from utterance length and a conservative
      speaking rate; a queued line that would start more than three
      seconds after the moment it described flushes the dead backlog and
      speaks immediately, and interrupting lines reset the projection to
      truth. Follow-up if the estimate ever misbehaves: scale the
      chars-per-second to the configured event voice rate.
- [x] **Dispatch lane variety -- SHIPPED 2026-07-15.** The profile
      remembers the last six delivered from:to lanes
      (`Profile.recent_lanes`, saved), and the assignment queue
      stable-partitions fresh candidates so an unseen lane goes first --
      score order still rules within each group, an all-recent board
      changes nothing, so the nudge delays a repeat but never blocks
      dispatch. Higher levels widening the distance cap stacks on top.
- [ ] **Billboards on short routes (playtest 2026-07-15).** Nothing was
      deleted -- the pools, corridor signs, and wiring are all intact -- but
      the spacing math (15-mile lead-in plus a 35-to-65-mile gap roll)
      means a run under about 30 miles usually rolls zero billboards, which
      reads as "the billboards are gone" on short-lane days. Scale the
      lead-in and gap down on short routes so even an errand run can pass
      one sign.
- [ ] **Brake-heat sensory ladder (owner ask 2026-07-15).** The physics
      already tracks brake temperature continuously (heating, cooling,
      fade onset, effectiveness collapse) but the player only hears three
      coarse buckets buried in the detailed status readout, plus a squeal
      that fires once it is already too late. Real trucks have no brake
      temperature gauge -- drivers judge by smell, pedal feel, and smoke
      -- so the honest interface is a five-rung spoken sensory ladder
      (cool, warm, hot, fading, smoking) with each transition announced
      once as the sensation ("You smell hot brakes", "The pedal is going
      soft"), a one-word trend on the hot rungs (still heating vs
      cooling -- the whole question on a long descent), and the heat word
      added to the quick status key, not just the long readout. Prime
      driving-school lesson: a long practice grade, snub braking versus
      dragging, when to grab a lower gear, what each rung means -- pairs
      with the latching-controls lesson (latch the brake, hear the
      ladder climb).
- [ ] **Ambience honesty: season, temperature, and region gate the
      wildlife (owner playtest 2026-07-16).** The night ambience sang
      cicadas over a 52-degree March windstorm in Holbrook -- wrong
      season (cicadas are a summer chorus), wrong temperature (they go
      quiet below about 60 degrees), wrong feel for a high-plateau
      desert night (wind, a distant coyote, honest silence). Ambience
      beds should key on the same season/temperature/region state the
      weather system already tracks: insect layers gated by season AND
      warmth, regional voices where they belong (cicadas in a Georgia
      summer, absolutely; Holbrook in March, never). And the gate swings
      both ways (owner, same night): a per-season palette, not just
      evictions -- spring peepers near Midwest water at dusk, the full
      summer chorus in the South, fall geese overhead, and winter's
      snow-muffled hush. A rest stop should sound like a date on a
      calendar somewhere real. Audit the existing loops against this
      rule; the owner's NAS library sources both the evictions'
      replacements and the new seasonal beds.
- [ ] **Cab and rig sonification pass (owner 2026-07-15).** The state the
      truck is in should be hearable before it is spoken. First candidates:
      a chain-clatter loop whenever chains are mounted, pitched and paced
      with speed -- on snow it is texture, on bare pavement it is the
      warning that saves the set (the physics snaps a cross chain after
      about two dry miles at highway speed; today the snap is the first
      thing you hear); a wear-based brake squeak (worn pads chirp at every
      stop -- the real wear-indicator sound, distinct from the existing
      too-hot squeal); the latch catch click (shipped 2026-07-15 with a
      ui/tick placeholder -- swap for a proper cab sound in this pass).
      Also: a true shift sound (driveline clunk + air/turbo breath --
      the click is UI, not a truck), auditioned only AFTER the engine
      voices revs honestly across shifts (the low-gear bullet below).
      Community votes 2026-07-17 (antonio luigi): the JAKE needs its
      sound most of all (the slowing works, silently -- and the jake
      sample is the known library gap), and the service-brake RELEASE
      should breathe its little air sigh, not just the apply.
      vehicle/brake_release.ogg already ships -- check the wiring.
      Sourcing ladder (owner, REVISED 2026-07-22): Splice first (both
      maintainers hold licenses), then freesound CC0/CC-BY, then
      ElevenLabs generation (character sounds only, never
      timing-critical transients), then field recording (a community
      call for truck recordings is an option), then CC-licensed YouTube
      only, with attribution -- never ordinary YouTube rips. The NAS
      library has NO KNOWN PROVENANCE and is reference/measurement
      material only -- nothing cut from it may ship. CREDITS.md tracks
      provenance for every asset.
      NAS SWEEP DONE 2026-07-18: `docs/sound-shortlist.md` lists
      unauditioned candidates for all seven needs plus ready-to-run
      ElevenLabs prompts. Three findings change the plan. (a) The
      RUMBLE STRIP DOES NOT EXIST in the 62,280-file library -- no
      washboard, no corrugation, no shoulder-drift take; it has to be
      synthesized as a speed-tracking pulse train over a gravel noise
      floor (Sound Ideas 6009 "Auto Road Surfaces" supplies the floor),
      which is the better answer anyway since the buzz rate should
      follow wheel speed. (b) The CURVE TONE LADDER has its material:
      Sony Vol. 4 Vintage Cartoon holds thirteen chromatic `Xylophone
      Single Note` one-shots from one session -- one timbre, three
      pitches, exactly the RFC 1b grammar. (c) TURBO AND DRIVELINE are
      thin (no wastegate, no blow-off, no diesel turbo anywhere), so
      the shift sound gets built from a GMC 6000 gear clunk plus a
      pitched-down transmission clunk plus an air release.
- [ ] **Provenance audit of shipped sound assets (owner, 2026-07-22).**
      The Duff-shared cues cannot ship -- he holds no license for the
      material he passed along (owner ruling, 2026-07-22), so every
      Duff row is a replacement, not a check. Audit ran 2026-07-22
      (git history of every unlabeled row): the 2026-06-18 batch
      (weather, event cues, POI/ambience loops) is all project-clean
      ElevenLabs/procedural work, never swapped since -- weather
      re-sourcing from Splice is now a quality upgrade, not a
      compliance fix. One mislabel found and corrected:
      `ambient/night.ogg` was credited "original" but came from
      Darren's sound pack. Replacements owed: vehicle/horn.ogg,
      driver/yawn.ogg, ambient/night.ogg (Splice); the engine-voice
      rebuild retires idle/start/shutdown, gear_shift, and both
      parking-brake cues.
- [x] **Bobtail means no trailer at all (forum report, SRD625
      2026-07-17).** Shipped 2026-07-22: `trailer_attached` on the truck
      drops the dry van's 6.4 t from the tare on reposition and
      city-service drives, and the air gauge stops waiting on the
      disconnected trailer line. Deadhead-with-empty-trailer keeps the
      old number. Shipped alongside the load-aware shift scheduling the
      same investigation exposed: the lug guard now scales with load
      (empty rigs pull up from 800 rpm instead of bouncing every
      skip-shift), and the stopped-gear reset honors the light start
      gear. Bench anchors, 45 mph from rest: bobtail 15.7 s, deadhead
      20.3 s, loaded 38.7 s.
- [ ] **Dispatch board first-visit hitch (forum lead, Draq via Claude
      2026-07-17).** JobBoard._candidates() walks all 623 cities with
      supported_route() on the first board build in each city --
      measured ~350 ms per new city on a fast machine (then 0: the
      session cache already fixed the old multi-second lag, as SRD625
      reported). Polish: warm the cache off-thread on city arrival so
      even the first board opens instantly on slow hardware.
- [x] **Engine and shift audio tells the truth at low speed -- SHIPPED
      2026-07-22 (sound/engine-integration), owner's ear audition
      owed.** The diagnosed fix option 1 landed, upgraded: BASS now
      voices the engine as a multisample ring of four REAL 896 cab
      cuts at their recorded rpms (680/1000/1150/1800), crossfaded
      equal-power with per-band playback-rate slides of rpm/native
      (clamped 0.85-1.30), so pitch tracks RPM proportionally through
      every launch pull. Shifts play real recorded cuts from the same
      cab (manual and automatic round-robin banks; the gear click is
      retired in overlay builds). Cold starts fast-idle at 900 while
      the compressor builds air (physics change, vehicle.py), with the
      fill hiss and the settle as the drive-ready flip. Brake press
      plays the clunk bank leveled by force; release breathes the air
      back out, scaled by how hard you braked. Career 1.9 now carries
      the approved encrypted sound pack through Git LFS, so source and
      release builds use the same audio without distributing the raw
      library recordings. (3) SHIPPED 2026-07-24: the
      engagement clunk at shift END, together with the shift SIGH --
      the voice now follows the physics rpm falling toward the new
      gear through the interrupt (ducked, unloaded) instead of the
      frozen pre-shift hang; kachunk -- sigh -- kachunk per the
      owner's ear. (4) OBSOLETE: Phil's modern-AMT power upshifts
      (155f05ad, 0.25-0.5 s) already went past the 0.7 s idea. Also
      open: launch/load rev one-shots (engine/rev_launch, rev_load are
      encoded and staged but not yet wired -- mixing them over the
      ring needs the owner's ear) and per-trigger pitch jitter on the
      banks (needs a playback-rate parameter on one-shots).
- [ ] **Audible traffic -- hear the vehicle you overtake (owner idea
      2026-07-16).** Traffic already exists as modeled vehicles with
      lanes and speeds; give the near ones voices: continuous positional
      emitters (engine/tire loops) panned by relative lane and faded by
      gap, so closing on a slow truck is heard before any speech, an
      overtake tracks past the window, and a vehicle sitting in the
      passing lane is audible before a lane change -- the ear-level
      groundwork that makes real overtaking decisions possible. Speech
      stays the fallback (L and the traffic status already report
      lanes); sounds from the NAS library. Infrastructure work on our
      side of the fence -- independent of the steering-grammar design
      offered to Josh.
- [ ] Runaway truck ramps as regular highway furniture on steep descents: the
      real ramps are now baked (96 tagged escape ramps with side and milepost
      in `world_data/us/gameplay/ramps.jsonl`, read offline from the local
      Geofabrik PBFs), so approach announcements and the escape move are
      wiring work now, not a data gap -- announced on approach, takeable as
      the escape move when the brakes are gone (the physics already runs away
      honestly -- bench `grade-runaway` tops 149 mph and grenades the engine
      past redline). Curated DOT gap-fill welcome later; never synthesized
      where the real road has none (owner call 2026-07-15).
- [ ] **Runaway ramp aftermath (owner design 2026-07-15).** An arrester
      bed buries the rig to the axles; you do not drive out. The sequence:
      gravel roar and grind-down, cab contents going forward, air hiss,
      then ticking silence -- and the truck is stuck with the engine fine
      and the brakes cooked. Mandatory roadside call for a heavy-wrecker
      winch-out: expensive, hours lost, carrier-billed for company
      drivers, the GOLDEN FLARE membership's flagship moment. NO citation
      ever -- taking the ramp is the right move and must never score worse
      than the alternative; the lesson costs money and time, not blame.
- [ ] **Crash consequence tiers (owner design 2026-07-15).** Today every
      collision scrubs speed, adds at most 18 percent damage, and you keep
      rolling -- there is no catastrophic outcome. Add a severity
      threshold: below it, today's fender-bender behavior stands; above
      it the truck is DISABLED where it sits -- tow to the nearest city,
      trip over, load salvaged or claimed, a heavy invoice, and a safety
      record strike a carrier cares about. Head-ons and rollovers are the
      tier's ceiling (truck effectively totaled, load gone). The player
      always walks away -- "You walked away. The truck didn't." -- the
      wallet, the clock, and the record take the damage, never the
      driver.
- [x] **Ramp endings announced early, and in real time -- SHIPPED
      2026-07-15.** Both prongs, exactly as designed off the log receipt
      (exit 17:00:13, sign blown 17:00:18): (1) the signal-on
      announcement names the ending ("The ramp ends at a stop sign.")
      with a mile-plus of mainline to plan on, and the U upcoming key
      carries the same phrase -- the terminal-control decision was made
      previewable (`_ramp_control_for`, pure function of trip seed +
      baked OSM data) so the early call and the ramp always agree; (2)
      `trip.controlled_ramp` pins the clock to REAL time from the gore
      until the truck is through a light/sign terminal, instead of
      easing compression only with speed. Free-flow ramps compress as
      before.
- [ ] **Signal running: dice and tickets, not a guaranteed clip (owner
      playtest 2026-07-15).** Blowing the ramp-end red or stop sign today
      ALWAYS clips cross traffic and never draws a citation -- backwards
      on both counts. Make the clip a seeded traffic roll (sometimes the
      horn and a near miss, sometimes a T-bone that belongs in the
      catastrophic tier), and make running the light risk a citation on
      the existing trooper/citation rails (chain-law checkpoint pattern).
      Rides the back-road stoplights feature where the signal mechanic
      lives.
- [x] **Dense maxspeed and curve-geometry sweep (2026-07-15).** Every leg in
      the country re-sampled along its real routed geometry with a
      curvature-adaptive sampler (dense through curves, collapsed on tangents):
      posted speed limits now step through the real canyon and mountain zones a
      driver hears, instead of one heuristic guess -- all 1,287 legs carry a
      profile and the anchor linter reports zero on the fresh data. The same
      pass banked the fine data the driving model needs next: 63,724 per-curve
      records (radius, direction, and a physics advisory speed v = sqrt(a_lat
      R)) and 96 real runaway-truck ramps, stored as delta-encoded, sharded,
      regenerable text under `world_data/us/geometry` and
      `world_data/us/gameplay`. Tools: `bake_curve_geometry.py` (the sweep) and
      `harvest_escape_ramps.py` (escape ramps read offline from the local
      Geofabrik PBFs, since the self-hosted Overpass extract omits them).
- [x] **Coverage-gap markers end the town-limit smear (2026-07-19).** The
      sweep always knew where OSM tagging ran out (`mph: null` rows in the
      derived shard) but the world schema dropped them, so a village 30 could
      rule miles of untagged highway (player-found live: NY-12 out of Norwich
      held 30 for nine miles). The schema, runtime, anchor repair, and bake
      now carry the markers end to end -- inside a gap the road reverts to the
      highway/region heuristic. 670 markers migrated onto 391 legs from the
      existing sweep shard; 8 never-swept legs heal when the sweep reaches
      them. Paired with co-driver speech: a warn-worthy posted drop is called
      ahead with pacenote timing, and a short town zone has its length spoken
      on entry.
- [ ] Lateral traction on curves and ramps: the curve geometry now exists (the
      2026-07-15 sweep above bakes per-curve radius, direction, and an advisory
      speed per leg), but the 1-D truck model does not yet consume it -- so
      cornering grip, curve-speed advisories keyed to load and ice, and
      rollover/off-tracking stay future, now unblocked on the data side and
      gated on surface streets for off-tracking.
- [x] **Chain laws and the tire-type ladder.** Traction equipment is now a three-rung ladder on the per-truck condition record: all-season (today's physics), winter compound (x1.3 grip on snow, x1.5 on ice, honestly paid for with x1.5 tread wear and a 3 percent dry-grip loss -- owner-operator garage purchase at a 25 percent set premium; company tractors run carrier rubber), and chains (x1.5 snow / x2.5 ice, steel replaces the contact patch so tread wear and hydroplaning stop mattering, $750 a set, carrier-billed for company drivers). Chain-law areas sit over sustained steep grade (5 percent for a mile-plus) and activate from live weather -- snow = Level 1 (winter tires or chains), freezing rain = Level 2 (chains) -- with a flashing-sign GPS callout on approach, escalation re-announced. Chaining up is a pause-menu act while stopped: 25 minutes and 6 fatigue by day, 40 minutes and 10 fatigue by headlamp at night (the lonely-snowy-night-out-of-Denver penalty, delivered); removal 10 minutes. Chains are consumable: ~500 miles used right, ~2 miles on bare pavement at highway speed before a cross chain snaps into the fender (4 percent damage, set scrapped, spoken cue). Non-compliance in an active law speaks a warning, then a seeded checkpoint past the area midpoint writes a $500 citation (0.6 staffed chance, one roll per area -- reloads do not re-roll). Bench anchors: ice stop 880 ft stock / 613 winter / 215 chained from 30; the chained jake holds the icy 4 percent it lost unchained (2:14 slip vs 15:06).
- [ ] Chain-up areas as physical pullouts: today chaining works anywhere stopped and the pullout is spoken flavor; a real chain-up area stop (safe, lit, maybe a helper service that installs for money) rides the stoppable-stop spine with Big Buck's.
- [ ] Road-stop tire service sells wear repair only; swapping compound (and pricing winter rubber) stays a terminal-garage act. Revisit if field tire swaps earn their menu weight.
- [ ] Chain controls by state personality: CO/CA tier wording shipped as the generic shape; later, region-flavored signs and the CA R1/R2/R3 phrasing on the California legs. Pure sign-wording work -- the corridors already carry curated ORS grades, and chain-law areas place today on 158 legs (I-70 Denver-Silverthorne, Siskiyou, the Grapevine).
- [x] **Profile integrity, client half.** `profile_invariants.py` enforces the hard, version-stable invariants (ranges, counter relations, closed enums, per-truck condition bounds) as defense-in-depth behind the Ed25519 signature check on every cloud restore, with a plain spoken refusal; unknown content keys from newer builds deliberately pass. `docs/profile-invariants.md` is the maintained validation list for the server gate -- hard rules mirrored in code, plausibility heuristics (money-vs-earnings, XP-vs-miles, achievements-vs-stats, possession-implies-acquisition with the Golden Antler as the flagship) specified for the server with exact game constants. Follow-up: the append-only event ledger that upgrades server validation from plausibility to recomputation.
- [x] Release-archive verification: after a player report of a Linux snapshot with no game file (2026-07-14 sweep found all published archives intact), `tools/build_release.py` now re-opens each finished archive and proves the executable (with its permission bits) and key payload survived archiving, and `build.yml` fails instead of publishing a release with a missing platform download.

Four threads: make the drive *between* the exits real, give every maneuver
and working hour weight, make the career read like real employment, and
make the world big and specific enough that every run feels like a place.
(Also releasing with 1.9: everything built for 1.8 that missed the 1.8.0
cut -- the exit setup, expanded enforcement, logbook, timed dock work, and
city service drives below.)

### Lanes and maneuvering

- [x] **The hazard call names the open side (owner decision, 2026-09-01).**
      Heard on I-90 with adaptive cruise on: "Change lanes or brake! Slow
      car right ahead." left a blind driver guessing whether a lane change
      was even possible, and the game already knew. Decision: lane changes
      stay driver-initiated (one tap of Left or Right with lane keeping on
      full; cruise stays armed through the dodge, which it already did),
      and the call ends with the lane answer in the L key's own words --
      "Left lane open.", "Right lane open.", "Either lane open." -- so one
      tap is enough. The side is read by exactly the rules a tap change is
      refused by and its arrival is judged by (lane count, the coned lane,
      and the same traffic clearance the L key sweeps forward over the
      change), through one trip-side authority the lane-gap cue, the L key
      and the call all share, so the call never names a lane the dodge
      would refuse. Nowhere to go -- one lane your side, or both neighbours
      held by traffic -- is "Brake! ... No lane open." and the hazard is
      not dodgeable (no lane-tap allowance, cruise pauses), the same family
      as the 2026-08-24 one-lane rule. Terse drops the opener and keeps the
      answer ("Slow car right ahead. Left lane open."); the low-speed "it
      is still in your lane" reminder names the side the same way. Bench
      finding fixed on the way: a test road swapped in under a drive left
      the traffic manager reading the OLD road's lane count, which folded
      every left-lane vehicle into the right lane on the first frame.
- [x] **Exit-flow speech honesty (playtest transcript, 2026-07-16).** The
      drift-on exit slowdown said "confirm the exit" though no confirm
      action exists -- obeying it toggled the signal OFF and cost the exit.
      Fixed four ways: the prompt now says "hold Right for the exit lane";
      inside the last mile a stray X keeps the signal (deliberate second
      press cancels); two quick Left/Right taps with drift on explain that
      taps only nudge the wheel (taps are the assist-off lane change, so the
      silence read as broken keys); and the terse missed-exit turnaround now
      says to re-signal. Same session: the All assists preset now drops lane
      drift to off (owner call) -- the easiest preset must not leave a
      manual steering task running; other presets still never touch it.
      Second finding, same transcript: the missed-destination-exit recovery
      only worked ONCE (the say-once latch also swallowed the reposition), so
      a second miss soft-locked the trip at 0 miles remaining with cruise
      dying every frame; and the turnaround dropped the player 1 mile out --
      a few real seconds under compression. Now every miss reroutes, and the
      turnaround uses the full _exit_window_mi() lead like a first approach.
      Third finding (turnaround fix verified live in the same session): a
      cautious stop on "brake to a stop" landed ~0.2 mi short of the ramp
      light's stop bar, outside RAMP_ACCESS_MI, where the waiting handshake
      never engages and one 15-second green cannot be crossed from a
      standstill -- an endless red/green loop with zero position feedback.
      Speech is now stop-bar-aware: a stopped-short creep prompt, at-the-bar
      vs short-of-it yellow/green wording, and the callout says to stop AT
      the light. Round 2 (verified live, same day): the prompt now NAMES the
      gap in feet/meters and says "drive up" past ~200 ft -- "creep" over
      600 ft spans several cycles and still read as broken. Open follow-up:
      consider a queue-position readout (S-style key) for distance to the
      bar while on a controlled ramp.
- [x] **Stop-or-swerve for fixed-object hazards (owner call, 2026-07-16).**
      "Brake to 25 clears debris" never made physical sense. Dodgeable
      (fixed-in-lane) hazards now resolve by lane change at speed OR by
      braking to HAZARD_CREEP_MPH (8) and easing around; the deadline
      budgets the longer stop via _brake_budget_s(target), a once-per-hazard
      hint fires if the player settles at the old 25 ("still in your
      lane"), and AEB brakes to the creep speed for these. Moving/surface
      hazards keep the 25-mph contract. Manual + in-game help updated.
- [x] **AEB budget honesty (playtest, 2026-07-16).** `_brake_budget_s` used
      the spec-sheet decel (rated g x weather grip) while the real brake
      model applies fade (to 20 percent when cooked), shoe wear, tread, and
      the overweight capacity cap -- so on hot brakes the assist engaged
      with zero margin and the collision landed 2 s after "Emergency
      braking engaged." Now `TruckState.full_service_decel_mps2()` feeds
      the budget (hazard warning lead times inherit the honesty), and the
      assist leads by AEB_BUDGET_MARGIN + AEB_LEAD_S for the heat the stop
      itself adds.
- [x] **Discrete lanes on the drift model.** `LaneKeeping` carries a discrete
      lane index under its continuous offset: with steering assist on,
      steering across the line is the lane change; with assist off, a
      Left/Right tap runs a timed change with signal clicks. Dodgeable
      hazards ("Brake or change lanes!"), sideswipe risk against real
      absolute-lane traffic, construction lane closures with barrel crashes,
      keep-right-except-to-pass CB nags, and right-lane exit gating.
- [x] **Signalized ramp terminals grounded in OSM.** Baked
      `traffic_signals`/`stop` nodes on 6,295 of 13,504 exit ramp links
      (heuristic elsewhere): a red/green cycle at the stop bar, grace
      distance, cross-traffic clips for running it -- now with dedicated
      red and green light earcons alongside the spoken callouts.
      Reworked 2026-07-14 after a log-proven playtest crash: lights now
      run a real green-yellow-red cycle (15 s green crossable from a
      stop, 4 s yellow, entering on yellow legal like the law), and
      every phase change on the approach is spoken -- the old one-flip
      announce cap could say green, silently flip red, and punish the
      driver for obeying the last thing they heard.
- [x] **Congestion grounded in FHWA HPMS volume.** Real AADT baked per leg
      drives clock-gated jams on a commuter curve: metro stretches jam at
      rush hour and flow free at midnight; entering a live jam injects slow
      traffic into both lanes.
- [ ] **Live traffic volume -- deferred to 2.0.** The split `world_data`
      tree carries no `traffic_aadt`, so congestion placement falls back to
      the metro heuristic and no jam lands on any route: a sweep of 12 seeds
      across 8 metro pairs found none. Sourcing live volume needs data work
      beyond the 1.9 scope, so it waits for 2.0. Until then nothing that
      depends on a live jam can be played or tested on this line, including
      the end-to-end speed-control case for heavy traffic, which is xfail in
      `tests/test_playtest_harness.py` for exactly this reason.
- [x] **Surface streets driven for real.** Tier-1 street chains carry baked
      per-segment cues and speed zones; boundary cues speak the maneuver
      with block-aware distances; city-passage and highway-pressure language
      is suppressed on streets.
- [x] **Steering audio cues.** The geometry builders bake turn *directions*
      from the signed bearing change at each road-name boundary ("Turn right
      onto", with near-straight name changes as "Continue onto"), and the
      runtime plays a direction-shaped earcon panned from the maneuver side:
      falling chime left, rising chime right, steady tone ahead.
- [x] **Surface chaining, arrival side.** The destination exit ramp flows
      onto the facility's tier-1 street chain and ends at the standard gate
      arrival, with clock/toll/weekday continuity and a `surface_chain` save
      marker; facilities without turn-level data keep the scripted arrival.
- [x] **Surface chaining, departure side.** A loaded run out of a
      chain-capable origin facility starts at the gate and drives the same
      street chain outbound -- leg order reversed and every junction's turn
      direction flipped -- then merges up the on-ramp onto the highway trip
      with clock and toll continuity and a `departure_chain` save marker.
      Facilities without turn-level data keep the scripted highway start.
- [x] **Tier-1 surface coverage expansion.** The "Data Expansion" pass of
      `docs/surface-roads-plan.md` shipped: the endpoint, local-approach,
      city-service-geometry, and facility-approach sweeps re-ran over the
      full 623-city map (5,486 facilities, 3,636 source-backed endpoints,
      6,223 of 6,233 approaches on named roads, 1,541 turn-level facility
      chains; 372 of 623 home-terminal yards start loads with turn-by-turn
      streets). The builders survived the slug migration and now print
      per-state progress. Still open below: widening the high-confidence
      facility-type set for turn geometry (grain elevators, cold storage).
- [ ] **Turn geometry for more facility types.** The turn-level route pass
      still limits itself to the original high-confidence type set (yards,
      cross-docks, warehouses, plants, ramps, parcel hubs). Grain
      elevators, cold storage, and food processors now have source-backed
      endpoints at scale -- extend `HIGH_CONFIDENCE_TYPES` in
      `tools/build_facility_approaches.py` after judging spoken-name
      quality on a sample.
- [x] **Street cue pacing and clean spoken names.** Street cues pace one
      maneuver at a time with a block-scale lookahead (a departure used to
      read the whole itinerary in one burst), and spoken street names trim
      raw OSM ref lists at load ("(SR 933;BUS US 31)" speaks as "(SR 933)").
- [ ] **Interactive street turns ride nromey's turn-by-turn work.** A
      steer-each-turn prototype (arrow key inside a reaction window, missed
      turns stop and turn around, realistic-preset default) was built and
      then withdrawn on 2026-07-15 in favor of the fork's richer
      turn-by-turn solution on the PR #75 line. When that lands, fold the
      one-maneuver pacing above into it and revisit whether manual steering
      still needs a preset hook here.
- [ ] **Normalize street refs in the builder sweep.** The runtime trims
      multi-ref lists to the first ref, but the baked data still carries
      them (1,185 in facility_approaches.json), and abbreviations like
      "BUS US 31" or "Hist" would read better expanded ("Business US 31",
      "Historic"). Fold proper ref selection and expansion into the next
      facility-approach/city-service geometry sweep.
- [ ] **Street chains for single-segment approaches.** A 2026-07-15 logged
      playtest out of Gary Intermodal Ramp had no spoken street guidance in
      either direction: its facility approach is source-backed but a single
      non-turn-level segment (2.1 miles on Richard G. Hatcher Boulevard), and
      the chain gates require a multi-segment turn-level chain, so both the
      arrival and the loaded departure kept the scripted highway start.
      Either let genuine source-backed single-road approaches drive as
      (turnless) chains -- "out of the gate onto Richard G. Hatcher
      Boulevard, 2.1 miles to the I-90 on-ramp" is real guidance -- or make
      the next facility-approach sweep try harder for turn-level geometry at
      intermodal ramps like Gary's before falling back to one segment.
- [x] **Template facility realism pass.** Template port terminals are now
      gated on a MARAD/USACE-derived allowlist of real deep-water, Great
      Lakes, and navigable-river port cities (282 -> 78), and template
      intermodal ramps are suppressed in ~250 towns with no rail intermodal
      service in dray reach (402 -> 157). Curated facilities are never
      gated, and accepting a stale cached board offer for a retired
      facility pulls the offer instead of crashing.
- [x] **Grant ports to the Great Lakes cities missing one.** Toledo,
      Detroit, Chicago, and Green Bay carry the port market tag as city
      tags and joined the template-port allowlist, so each now hosts a
      port terminal (82 template ports total). Their endpoint/approach
      records ride the next data sweep like any map growth. Dedupe
      decision: the 40 cities with both a curated port and a template
      port terminal keep both -- real ports run many terminals, and the
      extra facility is freight variety, not a realism error.
- [ ] **Surface intersections.** Phase 4 of `docs/surface-roads-plan.md`:
      stop signs and traffic signals at surface-street junctions, junction
      decision prompts, and traffic pressure at intersections -- extending
      the ramp-terminal signal mechanics (red/green cycle, grace distance,
      cross-traffic consequences) onto the tier-1 street chains. Deferred
      until local-drive pacing was proven in playtests; the per-system
      harness sweep now passes clean across all 38 corridors.

### Maneuvers, enforcement, and the working day

Mechanics finished after the 1.8.0 cut, so they release with 1.9 (the
detailed design notes live in the sections further down, whose "Shipped
for 1.8" framing predates the release split):

- [x] **Enforcement presence is the road's, not a setting (owner ruling,
      2026-08-16).** The `enforcement_presence` field, its levels, its
      settings row and its ambience table are gone. It never touched odds --
      `announced` is set for every staffed post at any level, so the "quiet"
      player was never safer -- but at `full` it played the marked-unit pass
      for EMPTY crossovers, and by ear that is identical to a staffed one. So
      the road sounded saturated with police, a third of whom demonstrably
      ignored a speeder going by, because nobody was in the car. An unstaffed
      post is now silent at all times: a marked unit you can hear is one that
      can act. Loudness comes from `Trip._post_density_at` -- deliberately the
      same number the placement walk uses, not a parallel formula -- which
      measured 0.47 to 1.49 across region, road class and clock, bracketing
      the slider's old 0.45/1.0/1.35. Old settings files carrying the key load
      unchanged: `Settings.load` only applies keys that still exist.
- [x] **Roving patrols could never clock anyone on a highway -- FIXED
      2026-08-16 after an owner-ordered harness playtest.** There were TWO
      blockers, and the first hid the second. (1) `PACING_MIN_REAL_S = 20`
      real seconds, unsatisfiable at any compression the game offers. (2)
      Even with that made distance-based, a pacing unit only banks road AFTER
      the truck passes it, while `end_mi` stopped asking it to look 0.3 of a
      mile past itself and the tracker ran to a literal 1.0 -- so the most
      pace it could hold at a moment it was allowed to observe was 0.3, short
      of any gate. Both windows now read one constant, `PACING_WINDOW_MI`.
      MEASURED, same roads and seeds either side: at a sustained 12 over,
      roving patrols went from 315 looks and ZERO catches to 350 looks and 7
      catches; total stops over 2,007 miles went 17 -> 24, one per 118 miles
      -> one per 84. Harness clean on five enforcement scenarios. Three tests
      added, including one that pins the gate inside the window, since
      nothing in 3,940 tests caught either bug.
- [x] **An opt-in guide tone ships alongside the bed (2026-08-17).** Does
      not close the bullet below -- the bed is still too quiet and still
      needs regenerating, which is the fix that helps everyone. This is the
      escape hatch for drivers the bed already fails.
      THE RULING WAS CHECKED FIRST, not worked around: the community ruled
      against steering tones (JaceK on the audiogames.net thread the owner
      posted 2026-07-17 -- continuous tones overwhelm the soundscape and
      hurt players with sensory or hearing conditions), and the owner
      concurred at the time. What the ruling objects to is a tone nobody
      asked for, so `Settings.lane_guide_tone` is False by default, an
      unreadable value falls to the bed, and silence-is-centered still holds
      -- the loop starts on the guide's wake and stops on its settle, so a
      straight road is as quiet as it ever was. Owner decision 2026-08-17:
      "we make it optional, the alternative is an unusable sound."
      Darren's candidate is the SPEC, not the bytes: 291.6 Hz at -16 dBFS
      RMS, both his. His file is a 1.45 s one-shot whose seam could not be
      trimmed into a loop (three attempts, best -35 dBFS), and the harmonics
      sit 40 dB down, so it is a pure sine and nothing else. Synthesized in
      `lane_guide_tone.py` like the ladder earcons: the sample count is
      chosen so a whole number of cycles fits exactly, which makes the wrap
      error zero rather than small. Credit him in the release notes.
      Auditioned against the real cab before wiring -- `engine/mid` and
      `vehicle/road` pulled from the pak, road at the 0.97 gain
      `set_road_noise` runs at highway speed, panned by GUIDE_PAN_MAX and
      PAN_SLEW_PER_S. Measured engine -18.7 and road -33.3, matching the
      numbers below.
      MEASURED 2026-08-17, and the worry was right: 291.6 Hz is the WORST
      of eight pitches tested against the real engine loops. Narrow-band
      energy around it peaks at 130.4 dB on `engine/midhigh` -- ordinary
      cruising -- against 121.8 at 1320 Hz and 122.8 at 880. That is 8.5 dB
      more engine sitting directly on Darren's pitch than on the quietest
      candidate, which is the difference between a cue that cuts through and
      one that smears into the engine exactly when the driver is holding
      speed. Higher pitches also localise better, which is the other half of
      what this cue has to do.
      NOT CHANGED WITHOUT AN EAR: the pitch is Darren's contribution and the
      owner approved it by listening, so a table is not enough to overrule
      it. An A/B of 291.6 against 880 over `engine/midhigh` is built and
      ready to play. If the ear agrees with the measurement it is one
      constant, `TONE_HZ` in `lane_guide_tone.py`, and the loop length
      follows automatically.

- [ ] **The road lean is inaudible under the engine, and the fix is the ASSET
      (Darren and the owner, 2026-08-17).** Measured: `vehicle/road` is
      -33.6 dBFS RMS against the engine loops' -18.7, and `set_road_noise`
      already runs the road channel at full gain by highway speed, so there
      is no headroom. The lean carries its meaning in the PAN of that bed, so
      15 dB down it carries nothing.
      TRIED AND REVERTED THE SAME MORNING: ducking the engine while the guide
      is awake (`GUIDE_DUCK_LEVEL`, measured 6.9 dB of room, road from -15.2
      to -8.2 relative). Darren rejected it before it shipped -- "the engine
      sound is nice and smooth and does not need to be tampered with at all"
      -- and he is right for a reason the measurement could not see: the
      engine is how a blind driver reads speed, load and gear, and a bend is
      when that matters most, not least. Reverted from the build.
      THE FIX: re-record or regenerate `vehicle/road` louder so the bed sits
      near the engine on its own. Fixes every use at once, touches nothing
      else, needs a repack (`tools/pack_sounds.py`) since the loose tree is
      builder-local and only the pak ships. Darren should judge the new
      recording before it lands.
      THE NUMBER TO HIT, and this is the useful thing that came out of
      Darren's candidate file (`sounds/lane beep.mp3` in the tester Dropbox,
      2026-08-17): **-16 dBFS RMS**, which is where his file sits and which
      puts it 2.6 dB ABOVE the engine loops. That is the level the bed needs.
      "Louder" was the instruction before; this is a target.
      OWNER DECISION 2026-08-17: wait for the ElevenLabs quota (resets
      2026-09-06, see the radio-station note) and generate the bed there
      rather than adapting Darren's file. His file cannot do this job -- it
      is a single 1.45 s sustained 290 Hz tone with 0.01 s of trailing
      silence, so it cannot loop without clicking, and the lean is a
      continuously panned BED rather than a one-shot.
      AND IT IS NOT AN EDGE CUE EITHER, which is where I nearly sent it: the
      edge boundary already has a three-rung ladder chosen to stay separable
      under engine noise (`edge_clip` intermittent, `edge_strip` periodic,
      `edge_shoulder` aperiodic), plus a single-hit rumble strip and the
      transverse strips. A discrete "you crossed the edge" beep would be a
      fourth cue saying what those three already say. The gap is the
      PRE-edge lean, and only the lean.
- [ ] **Learn game sounds demos cues the player's settings make impossible
      (Darren, 2026-08-17).** He reported the road lean as "very very quiet
      and you can hardly even hear it". Measured: it is not quiet. On the
      road the bed runs at 0.97 gain at 65 mph against the demo's 0.60, and
      the pan is `GUIDE_PAN_MAX = 0.8` in both -- the drive is LOUDER than
      the lesson. What is actually true is that the lean cannot happen for
      him: it needs lane departure warning ON and lane keeping off or
      partial, so on full lane keeping there is no lean at any volume, only a
      centred bed. The catalog's `when=` field says exactly this, but it
      lives behind F1 while pressing Enter just plays the cue -- so the
      screen teaches a sound the player will never hear and says nothing
      about it. Same principle as the empty-crossover earcon removed
      2026-08-16: a cue that cannot fire must not present as one that can.
      FIX SHAPE: give `SoundEntry` an optional availability check against
      live settings, and have `play_entry` say "your settings mean you will
      not hear this on the road, because ..." before or instead of the demo.
      Not done on build morning because it is a new mechanism across a
      catalog rather than a one-line fix, and the entries that need
      annotating have to be identified rather than guessed.
- [ ] **Things an officer never notices that the game already models
      (2026-08-16).** `_candidates` covers speeding, unsafe equipment, no
      chains, no lights, following too close and left-lane misuse. Missing,
      each already simulated elsewhere: an hours-of-service violation
      (`hos.in_violation`, and a roadside inspection is exactly where it is
      caught -- the most realistic omission for a truck); the engine brake in
      a no-engine-brake town (`Trip.engine_brake_ban_at`, which has its own
      ontology row); and wrong-way driving (`WrongWayMixin`). All three want
      a `WHAT_` reason, a fine in `models/enforcement`, and a visual-method
      post to see them.
- [x] **The deadline planner counts the bends (2026-08-23).**
      `route_drive_hours` walked the route on posted limits alone, so every
      bend the driver has to slow for was time the plan never budgeted.
      It now times each sampled segment piecewise: the miles inside a bend at
      that bend's own advisory, the rest at the planning limit. Overlapping
      bends collapse to the tightest advisory across the overlap, which is
      the one binding on the truck. Only the bend's recorded span is charged
      -- no invented deceleration ramp on either side, which is the sort of
      unmeasured loss `DEADLINE_PLANNING_SPEED_FACTOR` is already there to
      carry.

      THE COST HAS COLLAPSED SINCE IT WAS MEASURED, and that is the
      interesting part. The August figure was 2.8 percent of drive time on
      average and 5.6 percent Denver to Salt Lake City. Re-measured after the
      bank fix and the connector bake: Denver to Salt Lake City now costs
      0.05 percent, and Chicago-Indianapolis, Seattle-Portland,
      Atlanta-Nashville and Dallas-Houston all round to zero. The bends the
      planner was missing on the interstate were mostly the phantom ones --
      ramp and street geometry read as mainline, priced flat. Where the bends
      are real the planner now pays for them: US-550 over Red Mountain Pass
      1.9 percent, the Salt River Canyon on US-60 2.7 percent.

      So this lands as insurance rather than as a rescue, which was the
      stated reason to do it: the margin no longer erodes silently as curve
      enrichment continues, because the planner reads the same records the
      pacenote layer speaks.
- [x] **Highway exits take a real setup.** X signals the announced exit,
      the GPS asks for the right-side exit lane, checks ramp speed at the
      gore, and explains missed exits; destination ramps follow the same
      speed/lane/intent contract, and merge traffic puts spoken pressure on
      the maneuver. Since 2026-08-15 the approach is graduated rather than
      stepped: automatic control holds road speed and sheds along the
      distance still left, the arrival zones are sized from the destination
      facility's own approach record and never cap below ramp speed, and
      exit-traffic advisories speak only for an exit the driver is taking.
      Two more of Shane's reports closed on `fix/ramp-speed-control-resume`
      (2026-08-15): the ramp now PAUSES an armed speed-control session
      instead of disarming it -- in all three places that used to end it
      outright -- and lifts that pause by itself once the bar is honored and
      the truck is rolling again, so nobody has to press resume past a stop
      bar; a destination exit still holds until departure. And the approach
      glide is measured in real miles, with `Trip._armed_exit_decompression`
      putting the trip on the real clock for the shed window the way a
      controlled ramp and a severe curve already do, so signalling nine miles
      out no longer starts the shed the moment the signal goes on, at any
      pacing. The Rust follow-up to TowerAlphaTheta15's #185 keeps the whole
      1.5-mile exit-assistance window in real time, releases completed
      terminal brake snubs with separate engage/release thresholds, and
      honors the frame's accelerator override until release. Existing
      automatic lane-keeping exit assistance and data-driven ramp speeds
      remain in place. Rust regressions cover the clock, brake release,
      and the live input path. Battery scenario: `ramp_speed_control_handback`.
- [x] **Enforcement beyond the speeding stop.** Weigh-station blow-pasts
      and severe visible damage draw roadside stops; running from lights
      escalates through warnings to a felony stop with spike strips and
      loaded-run cancellation; construction zones stage a merge/flagger
      taper before the barrels; CB chatter hints at bears and work-zone
      enforcement a few miles out.
- [x] **The working day has weight.** An in-cab logbook records a real
      Record of Duty Status that traffic stops actually read; loading,
      unloading, and pull-ins take spoken on-duty time; loaded launches ramp
      in like a heavy truck; rush hour and corridor busyness shape traffic
      and hazard pacing.
- [x] **Three distinct driving-pressure modes.** Relaxed retains the 1.9 truck,
      traffic, weather, fatigue, and hazard systems with calmer spacing, wider
      reactions, gentler recovery, and quieter routine speech. Standard keeps
      balanced pressure; Realistic keeps the quickest decision cadence.
- [x] **Drive to city services.** The terminal's freight office, garage,
      and truck dealer are short local drives with sourced names, road
      context, and (where the data supports it) real street-by-street
      turns.

### Career, dispatch, and business

The other half of the 1.9 line: the career now reads like employment at a
real starter carrier, not a menu of freight. Detail lives in the Business
section below and the Unreleased changelog; the release-line view:

- [x] **Grounded start choices.** New careers pick among fictional
      company-driver starter carriers (assigned equipment, carrier-paid
      fuel and routine repairs, different wage/dispatch/freight tradeoffs,
      carrier-shaped dispatch boards) or a higher-risk owner-operator start
      with operating costs active from day one.
- [x] **A 30-level business arc.** Company-driver ranks lead to the
      level-18 leased-on owner-operator gate, level-21 authority prep,
      level-25 own authority, and independent ranks through 30 -- with
      distinct guidance voices per level band and haul-length caps that
      grow through the whole arc instead of maxing out by level 12.
- [x] **A months-long grind where every level pays out.** Rebalanced XP
      (flat completion lesson, deeper on-time streaks, clean-cargo bonus,
      stronger specialty multipliers) and re-paced level 21-30 thresholds
      put level 30 at roughly 300+ real hours with no single-level walls,
      verified by a deterministic pacing model (`tools/career_pacing.py` +
      `tests/test_career_pacing.py`). Every rank now names a concrete
      unlock: extra decline at 5, board depth at 6/10/12, specialized
      freight weighting at 11, premium long-haul lanes at 12, the
      owner-operator checklist read from 14, and fleet tractors below.
- [x] **Staying a company driver, and going back to one (owner,
      2026-09-03).** The buy-in was one-way and nag-forever: nothing
      recorded a refusal, and the next-unlock line, the status summary and
      the career plan repeated the offer at every terminal, board and
      level-up; the only way out of the lease was owing more than the
      tractor was worth. `Profile.owner_operator_declined` (saved; old saves
      load false) is set by "Stay a company driver" on Business status,
      which flips those three readers to the company ladder
      (`career_level_guidance` gains a "Company driver by choice" band past
      level 18) while the buy-in row stays; "Reopen the owner-operator plan"
      clears it, as does buying in. "Go back to company driving" (owner-
      operators, two presses) runs `solvency::apply_return_to_company_driving`
      beside the repossession: every owned tractor and trailer goes, for
      `company_return_buy_back` -- the used-sale share of catalog capped at
      the buy-in for the first tractor, the used share for the rest -- with
      no record entry, no setback notice, the same carrier, and a carrier
      tractor assigned. Rust only; the Python `dev` line still has neither.
- [x] **Dispatch-assigned company tractors.** A carrier fleet
      (`models/carrier_fleet.py`) assigns every company driver a tractor by
      level band -- yard standard, regional at 4, long-haul at 9, premium at
      13, first pick of the yard at 17 -- deterministically per driver and
      carrier. Tier promotions hand over a fresh unit at settlement with
      spoken hand-over text. Ten new tractor models fill the fleet and the
      owner-operator dealer catalog.
- [x] **Dispatch freedom is earned.** New hires run the load and lane
      dispatch assigns -- accept or decline against a small budget that
      refills on promotion, no route menu -- with load choice from the full
      board unlocking at level 8 and route choice reserved for
      owner-operators and own authority. Declined loads stay declined.
- [x] **The economy pays like a real one.** Carrier accounts cover a
      company driver's road fuel and repairs; specialty cargo and on-time
      streaks compound experience; reputation pays a continuous dispatch
      trust bonus; personal money buys endorsement courses and motel rest.
- [x] **Trailers matter.** Trailer programs for leased-on owner-operators,
      owned trailers under own authority, and dispatch rows that preview
      trailer fit and estimated take-home before you accept.
- [x] **A first day that lands.** A repeating first-day briefing until the
      first dispatch is accepted, a Career plan terminal item naming the
      next practical step, and a rewritten How to play that teaches earned
      dispatch freedom.
- [x] **166 achievements.** The badge wall nearly doubles and keeps
      growing: state, region, and city arrivals, cargo firsts, close calls,
      mishaps, and career milestones, each nodding to a country or trucking
      song. The 1.9 arc adds level milestones through 30, business-gate
      badges (buy-in, own authority, self-paid courses), fleet-tractor
      badges, map-coverage milestones (cities, states, the Dakotas,
      Montana, northern New England) sized for the 623-city map, and twelve
      song-city arrivals (Muskogee, Memphis, Kansas City, Saginaw, Fort
      Worth, San Antonio, New Orleans, Houston, Winslow, Chattanooga,
      Abilene, and Jackson -- Tennessee or Mississippi both count) via the
      shared `SIMPLE_ARRIVAL_BADGES` mapping. The copy rule now allows a
      song title in badge text when it is simply a place name; artist names
      and lyrics stay out.
      The 2026-07-25 pass adds twenty-one more over ground the wall had
      never touched: the radio (a station ridden until the hiss takes it,
      a fringe catch from far outside its contour, one signal held across
      three state lines, twenty-five stations found), driving craft (two
      miles of downgrade on the engine alone, drums cooked past fade,
      predictive cruise reading a real hill, a run better than eight miles
      to the gallon), the slip-seat yard (five tractors, every fleet band),
      calendar dates (Christmas, Friday the thirteenth, New Year's
      midnight), clean-record streaks, and a short row of deliberate jokes
      -- eighty-eight miles an hour, sixteen tons in one load, and a solid
      mile held at exactly sixty-nine.
- [x] **Rookie-arc achievement rework (owner-approved).** A first career run
      used to fire four unavoidable badges (`first_dispatch`, `air_ready`,
      `first_pickup`, `first_delivery`) plus up to three likely ones
      (`first_on_time`, `clean_delivery`, `speed_limit_saint`) before the
      player had done anything skillful. `first_dispatch`, `air_ready`, and
      `first_pickup` now fold into one new "First Day" badge awarded on
      pickup completion; their old ids and catalog entries stay so the cloud
      validator's allow-list never sees a removed id, they simply no longer
      trigger. `first_on_time`/`clean_delivery`/`speed_limit_saint` in
      `_award_arrival_achievements` now gain delivery-count floors
      (`>= 2`/`>= 3`/`>= 4`) so they spread across the first several runs
      instead of all landing on run one, just ahead of `five_deliveries`.
- [x] **Save compatibility.** Careers back through the version-4 schema
      load with sensible defaults, and newer-snapshot saves no longer crash
      older-schema loads.

### Radio

- [x] **Radio app on the driver tablet (2026-08-22).** Tab, Driver apps,
      Radio: now playing, power, save/remove the tuned station, a favorites
      list, a stations-in-range list, and Search stations -- a text field
      (the shared `TextEntryState`, extracted from career naming) over
      `RadioState.search`, which walks the whole allowed dial by name, call
      sign, or format, in-range hits first, capped at `RADIO_SEARCH_LIMIT`
      with the cap spoken. Every tune goes through `select_station`, so the
      streamer-safe gate and the dead-stream ban hold; tuning from a list
      switches a radio that was off back on.
- [x] **Now playing (2026-08-22).** ICY `StreamTitle` read off the BASS
      channel (`AudioEngine.radio_now_playing`, `parse_icy_stream_title`),
      polled on the reception tick; Shift+Y speaks it, the Tab radio screen
      and the Radio app carry it, and the drivers board line reads
      "listening to <station>: <song>" while the stream says. Built-in and
      playlist stations say they send no song information.
- [x] **Slow stations are not dead stations (2026-08-22).** Connect and read
      timeouts 8/10 s -> 30/30 s, and `RadioState.play` gives a station one
      fresh connect ("is slow to answer, trying again", spoken by the
      reconnect tick) before the session ban and the same-band handover.
- [ ] **Personal playlist and built-in stations could report a track.** The
      now-playing line covers ICY streams only; a playlist file's tags
      (BASS_TAG_ID3/OGG) and the fictional stations' rotation titles are
      both knowable and both say "no song information" today.
- [x] **The in-cab radio follows the map.** M toggles, semicolon and
      apostrophe tune the currently receivable stations, Y speaks status,
      Tab has a Radio screen. (The dial moved off the brackets when
      message review took them for its categories.)
- [x] **The full dial out of the box; one streamer-safe switch
      (2026-08-12, owner ruling).** The former pair -- streamer-safe on
      by default plus a separate real-streams opt-in (an earlier fold in
      the discovery line was reverted with it in `5e3e66a4`) -- is one
      setting again: streamer-safe mode, off by default, hiding real
      streams and personal playlists when on. Terrestrial now sorts
      strongest signal first; power-on retunes a fringe or out-of-range
      memory to the strongest signal; and the radio draws power from the
      engine -- silent in a dead cab, back on its own at ignition, with
      a spoken no-power line on the radio keys. Pre-fold settings files
      keep a deliberately-enabled streamer-safe; only the default
      changed. The manual playtest round
      (`tests/manual_playtest_radio.py`) then caught and fixed three
      more: the dead station's fringe static survived the fade-out
      handover for a reception tick; the Skip on the Far End badge fired
      on any deep-fringe listening instead of a genuine past-the-contour
      catch; and flipping streamer-safe on mid-drive never stopped the
      playing stream (it now hands over to the Roadhouse audibly, via
      the restored `apply_active_radio_settings` plumbing).
- [x] **Hosts, regional stations, and real signal behavior.** The Roadhouse
      and Night Line have live hosts; twelve fictional regional stations
      with newly composed songs cover markets across the map, fading to
      static at the fringe of their range and handing back to the Roadhouse
      when the signal drops.
- [x] **Real local stations across the whole map.** The catalog now carries
      57 real public and community streams (up from 14), filling Portland,
      Boise, Spokane, Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, Reno, Minneapolis,
      Milwaukee, Detroit, St. Louis, Houston, the Ohio Valley, the Northeast
      corridor, the South, Florida, and the southern plains, plus wide
      public-radio networks over the 623-city map's empty country (Prairie
      Public, SDPB, Montana Public Radio, Yellowstone Public Radio, High
      Plains Public Radio, Jefferson Public Radio, Interlochen, Maine
      Public, Vermont Public, WV Public Broadcasting). Each is geo-ranged
      like FM and verified with a live BASS smoke test; a coverage script
      shows 162 of 623 cities still outside every contour, mostly realistic
      radio darkness. The game now bundles and loads the BASSHLS addon
      (`src/freight_fate/lib/`), so HLS-only streams play too (first user:
      KMHD Portland).
- [ ] **AFN 360 Global channels stay unsupported.** StreamTheWorld
      geo-blocks those mounts outside overseas military regions (HTTP 403
      from US IPs on every URL form, HLS included); revisit only if AFN
      opens access. Re-checked 2026-08-04 against a fresh station list from
      a player in Europe: the fourteen Global channels they can play (Hall
      of Fame, Freedom Rock, The Groove, Mach 5, Jazz+, Country, Fans, The
      Blend, Joe, Legacy, Holiday and the Pacific variants) all 403 with
      `x-stw-error: 430 Invalid Mount` from here, on the same edge hosts
      that serve them audio, and the provisioning API reports the station
      keys as 404 from a US connection. Six more (Gravity, PowerTalk,
      Voice, and the Blend/Joe/Legacy Pacific feeds) 404 at the redirect
      endpoint from both continents, so those mounts are simply gone. The
      talk and news channels are all in those two groups -- there is no
      AFN talk station we can carry.
- [x] **Five more AFN Pacific bases (2026-08-04).** Iwakuni, Kunsan,
      Misawa, Okinawa, and Sasebo joined the AFN section from a
      player-supplied station list, each verified streaming from a US
      connection. All twenty-three regional AFN stations moved to the
      canonical StreamTheWorld redirect form, which is the numbered-edge
      auto-repair the 2026-07-27 refresh-tool findings called for, applied
      by hand to the AFN block.
- [x] **Imported broadcast and web tiers from PR #150 (2026-08-07).** 829
      real commercial and independent stations joined the dial under the
      curated catalog, plus a Web radio band of 5,023 internet streams in
      listener-vote order, all converted by `tools/import_radio_catalog.py`
      from the Radio Browser x Wikidata call-sign join CatalystForChaos
      built in PR #150. Curated call signs and stream URLs always win;
      every imported station is a real stream (hidden in streamer-safe
      mode). Terrestrial imports use the source catalog's default per-band
      radius (FM 40 mi, AM 90 mi) with no site elevation, so the terrain
      model's lift term simply stays off for them; the web band sits last
      on the dial, one category jump to skip. The BASS connect also moved
      off the game thread with real timeouts (their pattern), so a dead
      station no longer freezes a frame.
- [x] **Radio favorites (2026-08-07).** O saves or unsaves the current
      station; favorites are dial category 3 ("Favorites"), pulled forward
      from wherever they normally live, receivable rules unchanged. Stored
      on the profile as `radio_favorites` (additive, no migration; PR #150's
      approach). The imported/web tiers made this necessary: the dial is
      six and a half thousand stations now.
- [x] **The scale's arrival announcement dropped the truck-stop script**
      (2026-08-20, same day it was found). Arrival at a weigh station now
      says inspection station, the clock, and the current menu item -- no
      parking report, no live lot lookup, no brand amenities -- and the
      loyalty row is gated to hospitality stops.
- [x] **Cruise honors the weather's safe speed** (Brandon's suggestion,
      owner-approved and shipped the same day, 2026-08-20).** `weather.effects.safe_speed_mph` exists, is spoken as
      guidance on the status keys, and is consumed by NOTHING: adaptive
      cruise holds a set 70 through a thunderstorm until the driver taps it
      down (which is what the owner's own storm playtest this morning
      actually was -- the ease in that log was his fingers, not the
      automation). Proposed: ACC caps its working target at the safe speed
      the same way it caps for posted limits, announced once per weather
      change ("Heavy rain; adaptive cruise easing to 45"), releasing as the
      weather lifts; the resume line names it like any other cap.
      Recommended default-on with no new setting -- ACC already enforces
      posted limits automatically and this is the same class of road fact,
      a driver who wants to out-drive the rain can cancel and do it by
      hand -- but it changes feel, so the owner decides.
- [x] **The Million Dollar Highway gets its real freight detour**
      (2026-08-20, same day as Jerry's run). New corridor leg
      Durango-Moab (US-160/491/191 through Cortez and Monticello, full
      recipe treatment: ORS HGV geometry, fine grades, four checkpoints,
      maxspeed; rural POI sweep honestly empty), joining the existing
      Moab-Grand Junction edge. The durango-montrose leg carries a
      `truck_advisory` -- ADVISORY, not statute: verified against CDOT and
      2 CCR 601-4 that Colorado publishes no length rule for the segment,
      so routing applies strong avoidance (2.5x cost, calibrated against
      the ~1.7x detour carriers actually accept) and never refusal. Through
      freight detours; Durango/Montrose endpoint loads still drive the
      pass. Follow-ups: Cortez is a future node candidate (checkpoint
      today; promotion splits the leg and adds US-160 toward Four Corners);
      a spoken line at job assignment when a route includes an advisory
      road would be honest ("this run uses Red Mountain Pass").
- [x] **Company drivers get ASSIGNED repositions; the self-serve bobtail
      is owner-operator only (owner ruling, 2026-08-20).** Shipped: the
      dispatch board for a company driver occasionally (seeded off the
      board's own cache key, roughly one board in eight-to-ten) includes
      a carrier-assigned reposition -- an empty deadhead to a nearby city
      picked toward wherever has more freight locations, standing in for
      one of the board's ordinary slots rather than adding a ninth. It
      logs on-duty driving (not personal conveyance, unlike the self-serve
      bobtail), pays 60 percent of the carrier's loaded per-mile floor
      (`ASSIGNED_REPOSITION_PAY_FRACTION` in `models/jobs.py`), and earns
      mileage XP like any other completed drive. Abandoning one costs
      reputation only, never the five-hundred-dollar load penalty --
      `Job.assigned` distinguishes it from a self-serve bobtail (penalty
      free) and from a real load (money and reputation) in
      `driving_pause_states.AbandonJobConfirmationState`.

- [ ] **Weigh-in-motion bypass -- the dashboard transponder (Brandon,
      2026-08-20).** Real trucks run PrePass-style transponders: the
      scale weighs them at highway speed and a green or red light says
      bypass or pull in; nobody stops at every open scale any more.
      Fits the game as equipment with a progression angle (fleet
      provides it at some tier; owner-operators subscribe), a natural
      audio moment (the green-light chirp at highway speed), and it
      rides the scale flow reworked 2026-08-20. Red-light pulls and
      random compliance checks keep the scale content reachable.
- [ ] **Domain-named imported stations: 75 of 5,241 read a URL aloud.**
      "TheRadioStorm.com", "SoftRockRadio.net", and 73 more speak their
      TLD to every screen reader; two entries' whole name is just ".org"
      or ".fm" (the cleaner's empty-name fallback leaking a domain
      remnant). Needs a reviewed sweep, not a blanket strip: for many the
      ending IS the brand (KNAC.COM, 1.fm, SmoothJazz.com). Proposed
      cleaner rule for the mechanical subset: a single-token CamelCase
      domain splits into words and drops its TLD ("TheRockHD.com" -> "The
      Rock HD"); the rest are one-by-one calls. The Radio Storm itself was
      renamed by hand 2026-08-20 after the owner hit it on the dial --
      note it is a DIFFERENT broadcaster than the four curated
      Radiostorm.com channels, so five storm-named stations on the dial is
      honest, just crowded.
- [ ] **Imported-tier follow-ups.** Re-sweep the 371 HLS streams PR #150's
      build dropped (we bundle BASSHLS, so they play here); consider real
      FCC contour radii or curated `range_miles`/`site_elev_ft` overlays
      for high-listener imported stations. `radio_favorites` joins the
      profile shape: regenerate the cloud invariants export at the 1.9
      cutover (already on the cutover checklist). Dead-station manners
      SHIPPED 2026-08-08: a stream that refuses to play hands over to the
      next station on its band and leaves the dial for the session.
- [x] **Community/college/NPR coverage sweep (2026-07-22).** Fifty-one
      real stations joined the dial, each gated on the BASS live check,
      lifting real-station reach from 78% to 93% of the 623 dispatchable
      cities. KPFT (Houston) came back with its Pacifica mount; the Rio
      Grande Valley (UTRGV), Savannah (GPB WSVH), and Amarillo (KACV) are
      on the air; WFMU and KABF joined by name; and public-radio networks
      filled the Iowa corridor, the Plains, the Rockies, the Southeast
      coast, and the Florida panhandle. jpr-redding was repointed to JPR's
      new Zeno mount. Honest remaining gaps at the time: WABE Atlanta (later
      revived in the 2026-07-23 cleanup pass -- see below),
      KDHX St. Louis (defunct on air; 88.1 sold, no successor
      stream yet; market covered by KWMU), WFSU Tallahassee (mount refuses
      BASS), the far Montana Hi-Line, the Texas border west of the Valley,
      and interior US-50 Nevada -- genuinely thin country, left dark rather
      than faked. (Interior Nevada and the Texas border were later lit by the
      2026-07-27 NPR translator dark-corridor sweep -- see below; the truly
      stationless spots, Wells/Austin NV and Malta MT, stay dark.)
- [x] **Montana Hi-Line via translators (owner lead, 2026-07-22) --
      resolved 2026-07-27.** The Hi-Line east of Havre was already lit by
      Yellowstone Public Radio in the catalog (Havre, Glasgow, Wolf Point,
      Glendive, Miles City). The 2026-07-27 sweep confirmed the remaining
      gap honestly: Malta, Chinook, and Saco have no reliable public-radio
      signal (Malta's only in-town FMs are religious and commercial), so
      they stay dark rather than faked. The one real find is KGVA 88.1
      (Aaniiih Nakoda College, Fort Belknap), a full-power tribal NPR
      station that covers the Harlem/Dodson stretch -- carried forward as
      the follow-up in the dark-corridor bullet above (its stream needs a
      Chrome network-sniff to extract).
- [x] **Deadlines respect the hours you already burned -- SHIPPED
      same day (owner question, 2026-07-24).** Dispatch deadlines model HOS honestly for
      a FRESH clock (route-aware driving + breaks + a 10-hour sleep per
      11-hour shift, times 1.2-1.5 slack) -- but never look at the
      driver's CURRENT shift state at acceptance. Accept a one-shift
      load with six hours already used and a mandatory mid-trip sleep
      makes the deadline impossible. Real dispatch asks how many hours
      you have. Fix shape: feed hours-already-used into the deadline
      (or at minimum speak it in the briefing: "with your hours, this
      run includes your 10-hour break"), reusing the fair_active_deadline
      machinery that already does this for resumed saves.
- [x] **Log-check stops stop the truck and burn clock -- SHIPPED same
      day (owner playtest, 2026-07-24).** Root cause found in the log:
      the out-of-service order applied its 10 hours and ledger reset
      instantly while the wheels rolled (3 AM became 1:57 PM between
      two spoken lines). Serious HOS violations now run the real
      pull-over: lights and siren, signal and brake to the shoulder,
      and the ten hours pass parked with the officer's order spoken.
      Original bullet: An enforcement log check
      played its tone and said the driver was stopped -- while the
      truck rolled on unbothered. The stop should be real: truck
      braked to the shoulder, a realistic inspection duration off the
      clock (and off the 14-hour window), then released. Same shape as
      the pull-over flow the speeding rework wants, so build them on
      one mechanism.
- [x] **A non-qualifying sleep says loudly what it did NOT do -- SHIPPED
      same day (owner confusion, 2026-07-24).** Wake message leads with
      "did NOT reset" plus the window-close time; countdown warnings
      re-arm after any non-resetting sleep; the out-of-service stop
      names the blown limits in plain words. Original: A 7-hour berth sleep left the split
      pending and the 14-hour window RUNNING -- but the wake-up message
      buried that in one clause, and the owner drove into a window
      violation believing he had hours left (the "six hours" he heard
      was the deadline clock). Wake from any non-resetting sleep should
      lead with the consequence: "This did not reset your clock. Your
      duty window closes at X; pair 3 more sleeper hours by then or
      stop." And the window-close countdown deserves spoken warnings at
      60 and 30 minutes, like the break countdown already gets.
- [ ] **Violation class decides the roadside outcome (owner ruling,
      2026-07-24).** Caught DRIVING over hours right now: out of
      service on the spot, ten hours -- that is real FMCSA and stays.
      But a logbook ERROR or a past-trip violation found in the record
      (an unpaired shoulder rest from yesterday, form-and-manner)
      should mean the fine and a marked record that raises your
      likelihood of future inspections -- never an instant ten-hour
      hold when you are legal to drive TODAY. Wire the scrutiny
      escalation into the same patrol-frequency machinery the speeding
      rebalance will use.
- [x] **Assigned-dispatch drivers can HEAR the board they cannot pick
      from yet -- SHIPPED same day (owner design, 2026-07-24): an
      on-demand "Review the rest of today's board" option, owner's
      refinement over automatic flavor. Original:** Below level 8 the board shows exactly one assigned
      load, by design -- but the offer pool behind it grows with level
      (5 wide at 1, 6 at 6, more later) and that growth is inaudible.
      Proposal: the assignment board previews the rest of the day's
      pool as locked flavor entries ("Dispatch also posted: ...;
      assigned loads only until level 8"), so each level audibly widens
      the world and level 8 lands as a real payoff instead of a number.
- [ ] **Facility placement audit: 776 approach pins land too far out
      (Josh's Kenosha 35-mile deadhead, 2026-07-24).** The approach bake
      caps at 35 miles and 776 records sit past 8 -- geocoded pins that
      landed counties from their city (worst offenders pinned at exactly
      the cap). Runtime now clamps synthetic approaches to Josh's 1-9
      band as mitigation; the real fix is an agent sweep re-geocoding
      each flagged facility within its city's bounds (OSM name+type
      match, mark unresolvable ones estimated-near-city), then re-bake
      approaches and lift the clamp for genuinely-remote facilities
      that carry evidence. Flag list reproducible: audit script walks
      facility_approach_route for miles > 8.
- [ ] **Real speed limits for facility approach streets (owner ask,
      2026-07-24).** Street-chain legs carry defaults today -- 25 for
      named streets, 15 for unnamed service ways -- but a real arterial
      approach can be posted 35 or 45, and a blanket 25 for miles of it
      is not cool. Bake OSM maxspeed over every facility approach
      route's street legs (same sweep pattern as the corridor and lane
      bakes, self-hosted Overpass, honest absence: keep the current
      defaults only where OSM is untagged). A short 25 or 15 right at
      the gate stays exactly as it is -- that part is true.

- [x] **Real speed limits for facility approach streets (owner ask,
      2026-07-24) -- SHIPPED 2026-07-24.** Every facility approach
      street chain now carries its real OSM `maxspeed` where the road is
      tagged; the 25 (named) / 15 (unnamed) defaults stay only where OSM
      is untagged (honest absence). Read from the local per-state PBF
      cache the facility builder already uses, NOT the self-hosted
      Overpass -- that extract is the corridor extract (motorway..
      tertiary) and carries none of the residential/service streets
      these approaches run on. `tools/build_local_geometry.py` gained a
      maxspeed read threaded through its own osmium graph, so the limit
      comes from the exact way that defines each segment. Labels only: a
      full rebuild changed nothing but `speed_mph` (0 structural diffs
      across all 6,910 targets). 1,457 of 12,820 segments moved off the
      blanket default to a real limit -- 593 to 30, 404 to 35, 245 to
      40/45 -- the mis-blanketed arterials the owner flagged. The short
      25/15 and the 15 mph gate zone right at the dock are untouched.
- [ ] **Reefer rules for the reefer feature (owner spec, 2026-07-24).**
      Two rulings to build into the queued reefer-temp feature: (1) a
      refrigerated load means the engine NEVER shuts down at rests --
      resting keeps it idling and burns idle fuel for the whole stop
      (the game simplifies the separate reefer unit onto the truck
      engine, so engine-on is the cold chain). (2) If the driver shuts
      the engine off with cold cargo aboard: an immediate spoken
      warning, then spoilage as a percentage scaling with how long the
      engine stayed off -- tied into the degree-hours spoilage model
      and its claim path. A driver should never do it; the game should
      let them find out why.
- [ ] **Rebalance speeding toward police encounters (owner design
      question, 2026-07-23).** Today sustained speeding rolls against
      patrol intensity: caught means a real pull-over and ticket;
      NOT caught means a silent "strike" fine at delivery (the
      insurance/safety framing). The owner questions the uncaught
      branch: real life mostly punishes speeding through getting
      caught. Options to weigh: drop or soften the silent fine (shift
      it to a carrier safety score that affects job quality instead of
      cash), raise patrol-encounter frequency to compensate so speeding
      still carries real risk, and keep CB bear reports as the
      counterplay. Ties into Josh's cruise-speeding ding finding --
      whatever survives must never fire while assists hold the limit.
- [ ] **Fine speed adjust: step cruise by 1, not just 5 (owner ask,
      2026-07-23).** Plus and minus move the cruise set speed in 5 mph
      jumps; there is no way to nudge by 1. Add a fine step -- e.g.
      Shift+plus / Shift+minus for 1 mph (and the metric equivalent) --
      for dialing exactly to a posted limit or a curve advisory.
- [ ] **Food and coffee stops are free (owner catch, 2026-07-23, night
      drive).** The short food-and-coffee break at a travel plaza speaks
      its alertness effect but charges nothing -- a real stop costs real
      money. Belongs to the truck-stop economy and buffs pass: price the
      quick stops (coffee, meal, shower outside loyalty credits), charge
      at the register, and let the tiered buffs ride the same purchase.
      The new loyalty program (owner likes it) gives the natural hook:
      paid purchases should earn points too, not just fuel gallons.
- [ ] **Long repeating hiss at highway cruise (owner report 2026-07-23,
      CLAIMED: ff-audio session).** OWNER CORRECTION: not machinery
      engaging -- a GENUINE LONG HISS that repeats at steady cruise.
      Evidence gathered: the sim is innocent (log shows psi pinned at
      125, compressor idle, no brake applications on that stretch) and
      the ring bands measure hiss-flat (no in-loop fill hiss -- the old
      bug is NOT back). Prime suspect: cruise rpm 1695-1767 sits inside
      the narrow midhigh(1425)<->high(1900) crossfade window, so ACC's
      small rpm wobble slides the mix across the seam cyclically.
      A long hiss fading in/out fits the seam IF one band carries a
      hissier steady character than its neighbor (the swing scan only
      rules out WITHIN-loop hiss spikes, not a uniformly hissy band --
      measured means: idle .131, high .144, midhigh .149, mid .155,
      low .159, all in 3-8 kHz ratio). Also re-check the long-hiss
      assets themselves: brake_hiss_bed and air_pressurize triggering
      at cruise despite the gates. Candidate fixes: de-hiss the guilty
      band, widen/recenter the window, damp mix against rpm wobble.
      ALSO for the same session: the brake-release pssht goes missing at
      the final dock stop -- "Brakes set; dock menu opening" fires in the
      same beat and likely cuts the release sound before it plays (owner,
      Merced delivery). The arrival pssht deserves to finish; it is the
      punctuation on the whole drive.
- [x] **Shift transient lands AFTER the band crossfade (owner ear,
      2026-07-24) -- SUPERSEDED by the shift sigh (shipped same day).**
      The gap-then-re-entry hold this bullet defends was replaced at
      the owner's direction: the voice now follows the physics rpm
      falling through the interrupt (ducked -- the real between-gears
      sigh), the start clunk fires the same frame the interrupt begins,
      and engagement got its own soft end clunk. The voice moving
      during the interrupt is now intentional; re-open only if the
      owner still hears the start clunk arriving late.
- [ ] **Quitting at speed should confirm before discarding the leg
      (owner loss, 2026-07-27).** Save-at-stops is the right design,
      but the "this delivery will resume from your last stop" warning
      speaks WHILE the quit executes -- too late to matter. The owner
      quit at 76 mph on I-80 (relaunching for an audio test) and lost
      67 miles back to the trip start. Quit-to-menu while moving should
      ask first, and say the cost in miles: "You will lose 67 miles
      since your last stop. Quit anyway?" Parked quits stay instant.
      Same session, related surprise worth a product look with Josh:
      resuming always starts you parked with the brake set even when
      the save context was mid-corridor -- honest, but it should
      narrate itself ("pulled to the shoulder at your last checkpoint")
      so the stopped truck makes story sense.
- [x] **Randomize sound loop edges (owner + ChatGPT ideas, 2026-07-27,
      SHIPPED same day as the engine-ring wobble).** The suggestions were
      reviewed in the audio session: seam/phase advice was already done
      (WAV + circular splice), and micro-variation won as the cure for
      the fixed-period signature. Each engine band's rate and gain now
      takes a slow bounded random walk (~5 cents / ~0.5 dB, sqrt(dt)
      diffusion in the BASS backend) so the loop period never lands
      where the ear predicted. STILL OPEN if the ear still catches it:
      spectral loop EXTENSION -- regenerate the formant-model cuts at
      4-6 s with continuous harmonics over a fresh-random noise floor,
      shrinking the fingerprint itself; and the dual-loop LCM overlap
      idea stays deferred (doubles the stream count).
- [x] **Ring rebuild: longer spectrally-extended cuts -- SHIPPED
      2026-07-27 (final-slate Track A, owner ear sign-off: "chef's
      kiss").** tools/engine_ring_extend.py resynthesizes each driving
      band FROM its own approved cut at ~5 s: partials detected at
      revolution-rate harmonics (firing lines AND lope sidebands),
      rebuilt as exact circular sinusoids with slow per-octave wander,
      over a fresh-random-phase noise floor shaped by the residual PSD.
      No splice, no seam, no repeating envelope. Measured: envelope
      self-similarity 0.30-0.52 -> 0.10-0.15, chug modulation
      preserved, transients clean. Idle stays the real recording;
      jakes untouched. Rumble-strip synthesis rides Track B.
- [ ] **Lay on the horn (owner ask, 2026-07-23).** H plays one shortish
      horn sample today. Holding H should hold the horn -- attack, a
      seamless sustain loop for as long as the key is down, then the
      release -- like a real air horn lever. Pairs perfectly with the
      horn replacement already owed (the current horn is Duff material):
      when the new Splice/synth horn is cut, cut it AS attack/sustain/
      release pieces so the hold behavior falls out of the asset design.
      NOTE (owner, same night): the horn already sounds SHORTER than it
      used to, but the shipped file is untouched since June -- so the
      audio rework's playback path is probably cutting it early. Check
      the play site before blaming the sample.
- [ ] **Refresh tool: periodic live-check of the whole radio catalog
      (owner, 2026-07-23).** The station search had a first-match-wins
      bug -- one hit per area and it moved on (one station in New York,
      NPR forgotten) -- and the full re-search now running will grow the
      catalog far past what a one-time BASS gate covered. Teach
      tools/refresh_map_data.py's --radio pass to re-test every stream
      on a cadence (streams die: KDHX did), report dead mounts for
      re-pointing, and keep honest-coverage rules: a dead stream goes
      dark or gets a verified replacement, never a fake.
      Two findings from the first full 741-station run (2026-07-27):
      (1) the single-threaded `--radio` pass FALSE-DEATHS on StreamTheWorld
      -- rapid sequential probes get rate-limited, so it must host-partition
      or space same-host hits the way the sweep gate does, else it cries
      wolf; verify any dead list with a serial clean-session re-gate before
      acting. (2) The most common REAL rot is stored StreamTheWorld
      *numbered-edge* URLs (`NNNNN.live.streamtheworld.com/<MOUNT>`) that
      expire; auto-repair could rewrite those to the stable canonical
      `playerservices.streamtheworld.com/api/livestream-redirect/<MOUNT>`
      form and re-gate, healing most deaths without a hand pass. First heal
      pass done by hand (3a81da73): 13 restored, 6 unsupported honestly.
- [ ] **NPR translator/repeater hunt for the remaining dark zones
      (owner leads, 2026-07-27 -- next radio pass, 2.0 line).** The
      Hi-Line pattern generalizes: query the FCC facility database for
      service class FX (FM translator) along each dark corridor; every
      translator record names its PRIMARY station -- resolve to the
      parent network, BASS-verify the parent stream, seat it at the
      translator's dial position. Owner's concrete leads: KQEI-FM 89.3
      Sacramento (KQED repeater -- NPR flagship programming for the
      Sacramento dial) and Winnemucca, likely a KUNR Reno translator --
      which would start lighting the interior I-80 Nevada dark zone.
      Full-power repeaters (like KQEI) surface in the ordinary FM query;
      the FX class search is what catches the low-power translators
      Wikipedia and the first sweeps missed.
- [ ] **Fringe reception should burst, not fade (owner spec, 2026-07-23,
      ham-ear ruling).** Today the edge of a station's range plays static
      at a volume scaled by signal -- a knob, not a radio. Real analog
      fringe is BURSTY: random static bursts of differing lengths at
      differing intervals, each slightly ducking the music (duck window
      0 to a quarter second), with bursts getting louder and the quiet
      gaps between them shorter as the truck drives further out, until
      static wins. Randomize burst length and spacing (seeded, per trip)
      so no two fades sound alike. If a digital/HD station ever joins the
      dial its fringe is different and simpler -- it just drops out --
      but analog static done right is the foundation.
- [x] **Fictional call signs de-squatted (2026-07-22, Josh-approved).** An
      FCC license audit found eleven of the twelve invented regional call
      signs collide with real licensed stations; each was renamed to an
      FCC-unassigned sign with the brand and dial position unchanged. A
      second overnight pass against the FCC LPFM/translator databases (the
      records Wikipedia misses) caught two more squats: the twelfth sign,
      KRWL, is a real LPFM in Coquille, Oregon, and one replacement, KHRM,
      collides with a Nevada station -- both swapped to verified-free signs
      (KRWZ, KHRZ). Josh approved the full list.
- [x] **Full music rotations for the fictional stations.** A 52-track
      Suno-composed batch (via the Zero CLI) grows the format pools to
      radio-scale: country 15 songs, classic rock 17 (including a Saltwake
      tribute, "Greywater Quay"), blues and soul 12,
      ten new Roadhouse daytime instrumentals, four new night beds, and
      two Night Line-only vocal ballads. Second takes of the 24 vocal
      songs are kept outside the repo as auditionable spares.
- [x] **Menu rotation borrows radio instrumentals.** Six curated radio
      instrumentals joined the menu music pools: Steel String Sunday,
      Dobro Dusk, and Glass Highway rotate behind the daytime milestone
      bed; Freight Yard Moon, Midnight Siding, and Low Beams behind the
      night piano theme. Menus stay instrumental (no vocals or host
      breaks) so music never competes with menu speech.
- [x] **Map-refresh utility shipped (v1, report-only) --
      tools/refresh_map_data.py, 2026-07-14.** The owner-run drift
      checker: --radio plays every supported real stream through the
      game's BASS stack and reports the dead; --limits-lint runs the
      anchor-repair judgment rules as a linter (fresh bakes must report
      zero); --stops re-queries OSM per leg (honors OVERPASS_URL) and
      diffs live named truck POIs against baked stops, with a direct
      existence check around each baked stop's own corridor point so a
      sampled miss never reads as a closure. Never writes; exit code 1
      when anything needs attention, so a scheduled run can alert.
      Curation stays with the recipes. Future: fold in landmark and
      interchange drift.
- [x] **Personal playlist stations from M3U files (landed 2026-07-20).**
      Drop `.m3u`/`.m3u8` files into the Playlists folder next to the
      saves (created on first run) and each becomes a dial station under
      Your playlists, named from the `#PLAYLIST` tag or filename.
      Entries resolve relative to the M3U and may point anywhere the OS
      reads, NAS included; playback rides the music channel, so ducking,
      radio volume, and pause-menu continuity all apply, and the bundled
      BASS stack decodes mp3/ogg/opus/flac/aac/alac/wma with no new
      codec work. Unreadable files skip at play time (a sleeping NAS
      must not erase the station); each station remembers its place for
      the drive. A drop-in folder, never a file picker -- screen-reader
      users manage folders in Explorer. Personal media rides the
      streamer-safe gate like real streams. Owner report 2026-08-15:
      stream URLs inside a playlist were dropped, so a playlist exported
      from an internet radio app parsed to nothing and its station never
      reached the dial, silently -- fixed on
      `fix/personal-playlist-streams`. Entries are now file paths or
      stream URLs in the player's own order (a stream plays through the
      same async connect the curated real streams use, with a connect
      hold so it is never skipped for being slow); `.pls` files are read
      alongside `.m3u`/`.m3u8`; loading logs one INFO line per playlist
      and a WARNING for any file that yields nothing; a playlist with
      nothing playable says so instead of falling silent; and opening
      the Radio status screen re-reads the folder mid-drive. Follow-up:
      consider shuffle and a cross-session resume position if playtests
      want them.
- [x] **Radio dial categories with a jump key (landed 2026-07-20).**
      Ctrl+bracket (the owner's binding -- plain brackets already tune)
      leaps to the first station of the previous/next dial category and
      leads with the category name: route playlist, Freight Fate
      stations, your playlists, terrestrial, AFN, satellite. AFN got its
      own category so its 25-station block never buries the local dial
      again; the dial sort and the jump share one grouping.
- [x] **Fictional call signs must not squat real stations (owner catch
      2026-07-20).** Shipped 2026-07-22 -- see "Fictional call signs
      de-squatted" above. KDRT and every other invented sign was audited
      against the FCC database (including the LPFM/translator records) and
      renamed to a verified-free sign; brands and dial positions unchanged.
- [x] **Community and college radio sweep, and an NPR coverage audit
      (owner ask 2026-07-20).** Shipped 2026-07-22 -- see "Community/
      college/NPR coverage sweep" above. WFMU, KABF, college stations, and
      public-radio networks joined via direct station stream URLs with
      source notes, each gated on the BASS live check; real-station reach
      went 78% -> 93% of the 623 cities. Radio Browser was the finding aid
      only; TuneIn stayed out.
- [x] **Streams reconnect themselves; a silent radio never crackles
      (owner catch 2026-07-23).** The Merced ghost hiss: a live stream
      killed by a dock-menu bed (or a network stall) stayed dead --
      nothing restarted real streams, the same-URL guard blocked
      re-tuning the same station, and fringe static bursts fired off
      reception math alone every 6 seconds over a radio making no sound.
      Now the reception tick quietly re-tunes a dead stream (spoken
      fallback if it is truly unreachable), and static only plays under
      an audible program.
- [x] **Terrain-aware FM propagation with honest fringe audio (owner
      approved AND SHIPPED same day, 2026-07-23).** What shipped:
      elevation-aware contours (truck elevation from the leg's samples
      vs station site_elev_ft through the 4/3-earth radio horizon; the
      Rim case is a regression test; below the site is NEUTRAL -- a
      mountain-top transmitter looks down into its valley, so canyon
      shadowing waits for real path profiles, owner-test catch
      2026-07-24), the hiss-bed loop + sharp picket
      splashes replacing the 6-second burst timer entirely, exponential
      inter-arrival around 2v/lambda, program duck to 0.12 per splash,
      frequency_mhz + site_elev_ft on all 12 regional stations, and NO
      fringe over a dead stream. Original design notes kept below;
      follow-ups split into the next bullet. Was: replace the flat
      distance-falloff with
      line-of-sight over the elevation data we already carry: terrain
      profile between truck and tower decides the signal, so a river
      valley drops a station and a ridge crest brings it in.
      Acceptance test from the owner's ham experience: from the
      Mogollon Rim you receive Phoenix AND Flagstaff clearly at
      distances the current radius model would refuse. Fringe audio is
      synthesized, not sampled (FM has no static crashes -- the limiter
      rejects impulse noise): a shaped white-noise hiss bed rising as
      signal thins, blended UNDER the program instead of the current
      6-second burst timer, plus picket-fence flutter RANDOMIZED around
      the physical 2v/lambda rate (owner's ear ruling 2026-07-23: a
      metronomic 18 Hz tremolo sounds fake -- real flutter is a Rayleigh
      fading envelope, irregular nulls whose average rate rides truck
      speed and the station's dial frequency; synthesize as low-passed
      complex noise at the Doppler cutoff, magnitude out). It slows as
      you slow and stops when you park. Stations need a real frequency
      field for that; tune the noise shaping by the owner's ear.
      PICKETS ARE SHARP, not crossfades (owner ear ruling 2026-07-23):
      FM capture is a threshold, so render flutter as the Rayleigh
      envelope GATING program vs hiss with abrupt edges -- brief hiss
      splashes punching through clean audio, never a smooth linear
      fade. Picket density and depth grow as signal thins with
      distance (occasional single pickets at the strong edge,
      machine-gun picketing deep in the fringe, then mostly noise).
      RUNTIME, not baked (owner call 2026-07-23): the flutter depends on
      live speed so the bed must be synthesized in play -- hybrid shape:
      a seamless committed hiss LOOP as the texture with fade depth and
      the Rayleigh envelope computed per-frame as channel gain (the
      engine ring's machinery); fast flutter near 18 Hz gets steppy at
      frame-rate volume updates, so the BASS path likely wants a
      push-stream or DSP callback, degrading to slow wander on pygame.
      The 2026-07-23 static_burst regen (FM demod curve + de-emphasis in
      tools/generate_radio.py) is the interim burst asset AND the
      reference recipe for that loop.
- [ ] **FM propagation follow-ups.** Backfill frequency_mhz and
      site_elev_ft for the ~63 real terrestrial streams (real dial
      facts -- fold into the community-radio sweep; unknown fields
      degrade honestly to the flat model and a mid-band default).
      Later: true path-profile occlusion if off-route terrain data
      ever lands, and a BASS push-stream Rayleigh envelope if the
      one-shot pickets feel too sparse at deep fringe (perceptual cap
      9 per second now).
- [ ] **Tell "still buffering" from "stalled for good" on stream
      startup.** The reconnect loop recreates a silent stream every 9
      seconds; a slow HLS join that needed 10 could get interrupted.
      Poll the BASS stalled/buffering channel state before tearing one
      down.

- [x] **Whole-market completeness sweep (owner ask 2026-07-23).** Shipped
      2026-07-23. The dial no longer carries one station per town but the
      market's full non-commercial roster: public news plus separate
      classical/jazz sisters, community and college stations, and HD2/HD3
      sub-channels (the HD3s are how BBC World Service reaches the dial --
      WUKY, KWGS, KUT, KCND, Vermont Public). 396 real stations added
      (167 -> 563), every one BASS-gated 3x, across all 48 continental
      states + DC. Twelve parallel research agents sourced station-owned
      "listen live" mounts only (no TuneIn/iHeart), with FCC call-sign
      rigor and honest transmitter ranges; darkness stays honest where a
      market has no streamable non-commercial station. Each new entry also
      carries a `state` tag for the future main-menu Radio Player.
- [x] **Always-available international public broadcasters (owner ask
      2026-07-23).** Shipped 2026-07-23 (Phase 0, commit 61e79cbb). New
      "International" dial category carrying 12 English-language public
      streams verified from a US machine: ABC AU (triple j, Jazz, Classic,
      Double J), RTE IE (Radio 1, 2FM, lyric fm), RNZ NZ (National,
      Concert), RFI English, CBC (Radio One, Music). BBC World Service was
      excluded direct (its CDN 403s US IPs) and reaches the dial via US HD3
      sub-channels instead.
- [x] **Radio reading services for blind listeners (owner ask
      2026-07-23).** Shipped 2026-07-23. Twelve reading services (that read
      newspapers/books aloud for blind and print-disabled listeners) now
      ride the dial as real local stations -- WYPL Memphis, WRBH New
      Orleans, Sun Sounds of Arizona, CRIS Chicago, Triangle and Down East
      NC, Sight Into Sound Houston, GPB Reading Radio, WQCS FL, Vision
      Resources PA -- each tagged `reading_service: true`. Most of the
      category (per the IAAIS directory) is SCA-subcarrier only with no
      public stream, so those stay out honestly.
- [x] **Holdout cleanup pass (2026-07-23).** A fresh-session pass that
      cracked JS-locked / no-mount stations the big sweeps had to defer.
      New finding aid: `onlineradiobox.com/json/us/<call>/play` 302-redirects
      to a station's true upstream mount, so Brightspot and other JS players
      give up their stream without a browser. Un-darked WABE Atlanta (its
      StreamTheWorld HD1 mount plays cleanly once STW is not being hammered)
      and added two net-new public markets, KWBU-FM Waco (NPR/Baylor) and
      WLRH Huntsville; corrected VPM Richmond's call sign to WCVE-FM. Four
      more reading services joined the dial -- Iowa (IRIS, Des Moines),
      VOICEcorps (Columbus OH), the Nashville Talking Library, and the WUFT
      Radio Reading Service (Gainesville) -- lifting the category from 12 to
      16. Every stream BASS-gated 3/3 spaced from a clean session; Mississippi
      RRS, Omaha RTBS, and Detroit DRIS stay out honestly (closed-circuit /
      subcarrier / part-time only).
- [x] **NPR translator dark-corridor sweep (2026-07-27).** The map's
      genuinely dark stretches got their first public-radio signal, each
      seated at the real FCC translator or repeater serving the town and
      carrying its parent network's BASS-verified live stream. Interior
      Nevada now catches NPR along Interstate 80 (Winnemucca K217AX, Battle
      Mountain K263AB, Elko KNCC) and US-50 (Eureka K215CM via KUNR; Ely
      KWPR via Nevada Public Radio); the Big Bend of far West Texas picks up
      Marfa Public Radio (Marfa KRTS, Alpine KRTP, Marathon KDKY, Presidio
      KOJP) and Texas Public Radio at Del Rio (KTPD). Translator ranges are
      honestly short, so the signals fade in and out between the mountain
      ranges the way low-power translators really do. Every parent stream was
      re-checked on the BASS live gate three times from a clean session.
      Honestly still dark, no real signal, not faked: Wells and Austin,
      Nevada (US-50's loneliest stretch -- a test asserts Austin stays dark),
      Malta on the Montana Hi-Line (only a religious and a commercial FM in
      town), and Eagle Pass and Van Horn on the Texas border. Follow-up:
      KGVA 88.1, the Aaniiih Nakoda College tribal NPR station, reliably
      covers the dark Harlem/Dodson stretch of the Hi-Line, but its stream
      hides behind a JavaScript player -- a Chrome network-sniff pass could
      add it, and it pairs naturally with the planned tribal-nation crossing
      callouts.
- [x] **Community-radio second sweep (2026-07-27).** The dial skewed heavily
      to NPR and public-radio news (306 public locals vs 129 community), so
      this pass added the volunteer-run and student side. 162 community,
      college, freeform, Pacifica, and tribal stations joined the catalog
      (579 -> 741 stations), each FCC-call-checked and verified on the BASS
      live gate (parallel-gate false deaths re-confirmed serially from a
      clean session before anything was dropped). Twelve states that had
      public radio but no community station are now covered -- New York
      (WBAI, WNYU, WHCR), Wisconsin (WORT, WSUM), Virginia (WTJU, WUVT,
      WDCE), Kentucky (WRFL, WLXU), Vermont (WRUV, WGDR), Indiana (WFHB),
      South Carolina (WUSC), and more -- and the Pacifica flagships (KPFK,
      WBAI, WPFW) and the marquee college freeforms (KALX Berkeley, KDVS
      Davis, KZSU Stanford, WREK Georgia Tech, WXYC Chapel Hill, KVRX
      Austin) are on the air. Honest omissions, not faked: stations that
      stream only through phone apps (Live365, Mixlr, Zeno), internet-only
      outfits with no FCC license, and simulcasts of stations already
      carried were left out (77 such cases logged by the research pass).
      KDHX St. Louis was confirmed defunct (88.1 license reissued) and
      dropped. Follow-up: a handful of real stations whose stream the game's
      audio engine cannot open -- WRAS Atlanta (Georgia State), KNON Dallas,
      KUCI Irvine, WEGL Auburn, KRUI Iowa, plus WRIR Richmond and WVUA
      Tuscaloosa whose mounts would not resolve -- want a Chrome
      network-sniff pass, same as the KGVA follow-up.
- [ ] **Reading Services dial category with a "nearest" jump.** The data +
      tag are in; the feature is a new dial category whose bracket-jump
      tunes the geographically NEAREST reading service (not first-by-call),
      so the most useful content for blind players is always one jump away
      from anywhere on the map.
- [ ] **Main-menu Radio Player (browse-all utility).** A parked-only menu
      to browse and play any catalog station free of range gating, states
      as categories, reading services nested per state, International/AFN
      their own groups. Needs `state` on the RadioStation dataclass +
      backfill on pre-sweep locals. Accessibility-critical spoken menu.
      A `station_type` tag (public / community / college / tribal /
      reading_service / international / afn / regional / built_in / satellite)
      is now baked on every catalog record (data-only, loader ignores it for
      now) -- pre-wiring a browse filter that separates NPR/public from
      community and college. Whether the Radio Player exposes those as
      categories/tabs is a product call raised by the owner (2026-07-27) and
      forwarded to Josh; the in-cab driving dial deliberately stays a single
      scan-what's-in-range band (no genre tabs, matching a real car radio).
- [ ] **Radio cleanup pass: JS-locked holdouts + a real trucking station.**
      Chase the stations the sweep flagged but could not extract a mount
      for -- WABE Atlanta, KWBU Waco, the Richmond/Huntsville public and
      reading stations, ~37 IAAIS "no-mount" services -- via the StreamGuys
      sgplayer3 config.json trick and Chrome network inspection (proved on
      GPB Radio Atlanta 2026-07-23). Also hunt a real free trucking-format
      webcaster to put a genuine trucker station on the dial (SiriusXM Road
      Dog is pay-only/DRM and cannot be tuned).
- [ ] **AM news/talk sweep (next session -- needs fresh web budget).**
      iHeart is tunable via its public revma HLS mounts; Audacy is app-
      locked. Real-first so players lean less on the fictional fallback
      stations. Overnight trucker talk (Red Eye Radio, Coast to Coast AM)
      already rides free AM affiliates in the catalog.
- [ ] **Spotify and Apple Music: research only, parked (owner idea
      2026-07-20).** In-game playback of either is off the table --
      both wrap streams in DRM their licenses forbid unwrapping, official
      playback SDKs are browser or Apple-framework only, and storing a
      login to fetch audio directly would break their terms and put the
      project at legal risk. The honest middle path if ever wanted:
      Spotify Connect remote control (game OAuths, starts the player's
      chosen playlist on their own Premium client, mutes in-game radio) --
      audio would bypass the game mixer, so speech ducking degrades to
      crude API volume nudges. The M3U playlist feature above covers the
      underlying need -- your own library on the dial -- without any of
      this. Rides the online-enhancement determinism boundary if built.
- [ ] **Stream URLs rot fast -- fold a dial health check into the
      map-refresh tool.** One day after the 57-station sweep, seven
      streams were already dead (KJZZ, KCRW, KUNM, KUTX, KERA, KCUR,
      WBUR -- all repointed 2026-07-14 after a full BASS live sweep of
      the catalog). The owner-run map-refresh tool should re-test every
      real stream the same way and report movers, so the dial stays
      honest between releases.
- [x] **The desert Southwest sweep landed: six stations, ten total.** KTNN
      660 AM (Window Rock, the Voice of the Navajo Nation, 175-mile AM
      groundwave contour -- widest in the catalog, honestly), KNAU
      (Flagstaff), KXCI (Tucson), KRWG (Las Cruces), KANW (Albuquerque
      beside KUNM, like the real dial), and KAWC (Yuma), each BASS
      smoke-verified 2026-07-14. StreamTheWorld stations use the stable
      livestream-redirect URLs -- the numbered edge hosts Radio Browser
      caches rotate and die (that is what killed the first KNAU/KRWG/KANW
      attempts). Still dark: Santa Fe and KUAZ Tucson (skipped, KXCI
      covers the market); KTNN pairs naturally with the future
      tribal-nation crossing callouts.

### World and narration

- [x] **Elberton, Georgia added as a granite node (player request, 2026-08-16).**
      A contact-form request from William asked for the "granite capital of
      the world", left off the map. Researched and confirmed: Elberton cuts
      over a third of US monumental granite, ~90 percent of its output being
      cemetery memorials, with named granite carriers based in town. Added as
      a small specialty-origin node (population 4,640, no interstate) with
      seven real curated facilities from the Elberton Granite Association
      directory and the county development authority, plus three legs --
      Athens on GA 72, Augusta on GA 17 through Washington and Thomson, and
      Greenville, South Carolina on GA 17 to I-85 at Lavonia. Ten real
      checkpoints placed, ORS driving-hgv geometry and curve/maxspeed bake
      run. The one claim in the request that does NOT hold: Elberton is not
      why the country has granite at all -- countertop and dimension stone is
      overwhelmingly imported, and Barre Vermont, Texas, Missouri and
      Minnesota all cut monuments independently.
- [ ] **The new Elberton facilities have no baked surface-street approaches.**
      The city-services / facility-endpoint / local-approach / facility-approach
      sweeps predate the node, so its docks fall back to synthetic approaches
      until the next data expansion pass. Same standing gap as every other
      city added since the 2026-07-14 resweep; folded into that job.
- [ ] **Ninety auto-discovered stops are named by bare brand initialisms.**
      36 "TA", 32 "BP", 15 "76", plus CGX, CFN, TXB and a lowercase "bp".
      `AGENTS.md` calls this out by name ("TA" must be "TA Travel Center").
      The spoken form carries the type label in front ("travel center: TA"),
      so it is intelligible today rather than broken -- but the stop schema
      has no spoken override, so fixing it means renaming the stops
      themselves in one sweep across the network.
- [x] **Village and small-town callouts (landed 2026-07-19).** The route now
      names the small places it runs through -- "Entering Strawberry",
      "Passing Kennebunk" -- so a speed limit dropping to 35 in the middle of
      a mountain highway has a town attached to it instead of arriving from
      nowhere. 26,894 real OSM `place=village|town` points across 1,280 legs
      (`tools/bake_villages.py`), each projected onto the leg's real
      OpenRouteService route with its distance off the road recorded. Baked
      wide (12-mile catchment) and displayed tight: the ride-along speaks only
      places within 1.5 miles of the road, 390 of them positioned just ahead
      of the speed zone they explain; the wider set waits for the planned
      "where am I" key, which needs to answer "Winslow, eleven miles ahead".
      No hamlets. Spoken through the Place callouts ladder (below).
      Follow-ups below.
- [x] **Place callouts ladder: one setting for every place name (owner
      design session, 2026-07-20).** The one-day-old village chatter bool and
      the never-built checkpoint sparse mode (2026-07-09 design) collapsed
      into a single three-tier setting, because the split between "curated
      place markers" and "swept villages" is data provenance, not anything a
      player can hear. "Place callouts: off / sparse / all", sparse the
      default: sparse speaks only names that explain a speed limit change
      (probed from the baked corridor limits at trip build, deterministic,
      never from random work zones); all adds the pass-through towns and, on
      worlds that carry them, the curated route markers; the two-mile advance
      cue for places is dead at every tier -- a town is not actionable the way
      an exit is. Limit-explaining villages are seated before spacing thins
      the rest, so Strawberry and Pine both survive their shared window. The
      1.9 world carries zero legacy checkpoint markers (discovered in this
      pass -- the checkpoint speech only ever fires on dev's world), so the
      same code governs both lines with no version awareness.
- [ ] ~~Extract the place-callouts ladder to dev as a small PR.~~
      Investigated 2026-07-22 and deferred: dev's monolith world carries no
      positioned corridor limits, so the sparse tier's limit probe would find
      nothing and the default tier would speak nothing. A faithful port drags
      the dense-limits sweep along -- bulk, not a small PR. Dev gets the
      ladder with the 1.9 world at the release merge.
- [ ] **Village bake: per-leg cap and the wide catchment.** 569 of 1,280 legs
      hit the 30-places-per-leg cap, so their far field (5 to 12 miles off the
      road) is truncated. Harmless for the ride-along, which never reaches
      past 1.5 miles, but the "where am I" key will want the cap raised or
      replaced with a distance-ranked store before it ships.
- [ ] **Villages should carry their own state.** The bake reports counts by
      the state the LEG starts in, not the state the village is in, so a place
      in Washington on a Portland to Seattle leg counts as Oregon. Store the
      real state per record when the orientation readout needs to speak it.
- [ ] **Township and neighbourhood names in the OSM place layer.** OSM tags
      some townships ("Deptford Township") and a few neighbourhoods ("Journal
      Square") as `place=village|town`. They are real names and they read
      aloud correctly, but they are not places a driver arrives at. Worth a
      curated exclusion pass if they grate in play.
- [ ] **Places across a river read as passing.** On the Columbia the route is
      on the Oregon bank and a Washington town can sit under a mile away, so
      it speaks as "Passing Wishram". True, but worth a look in play.
- [x] **Official truck-parking capacity on rest stops (landed 2026-07-17).**
      The FHWA Jason's Law survey (USDOT BTS NTAD Truck Stop Parking, the
      dataset behind the national truck-parking inventory) now annotates
      checked-in stops: 68 stops on 57 legs carry a surveyed
      `parking_spaces` count, spoken with the parking certainty ("confirmed
      truck parking, 45 spaces"), and the overnight parking crunch is
      capacity-aware -- a surveyed 8-spot turnout fills earlier than a
      100-spot travel plaza. Annotation runs offline from a downloaded
      snapshot (`tools/curate_route_pois.py --annotate-parking`), matches
      conservatively (distinctive-name overlap, or same-class public
      facility at the same spot; a branded travel center never inherits a
      nearby public lot's count), and records the source on each stop.
- [x] **Unmatched Jason's Law records offered as fill POIs (landed
      2026-07-17).** `curate_route_pois.py --jasons-law-only` annotates
      first, then offers only the records that matched no checked-in stop
      as new public rest-area POIs on legs under the stop-density
      thresholds (3-mile corridor radius, offline from the local
      snapshot). Netted 2 new surveyed lots (I-90 near Presho SD, I-25
      Mile 129 turnout); 9 under-threshold legs have no surveyed lot
      within reach and keep their coverage gap visible. Survey names are
      whitespace-sanitized and mile-marker jargon is spoken as "Mile";
      one previously committed survey name with an embedded newline
      (Hancock County Welcome Center) was cleaned in the same pass.
- [x] **Posted low-clearance and weight-limit advisories (landed
      2026-07-17).** OSM `maxheight`/`maxweight` tags on mainline corridor
      ways now bake into `corridor.restrictions`
      (`tools/build_interchanges.py --restrictions`, offline from the cached
      per-state extracts), and the GPS speaks them ahead like toll points:
      "In 2 miles, low clearance ahead: posted 13 feet 6 inches." Routing
      already avoids impassable bridges, so these are the advisory signs a
      legal truck really passes; a bearing gate keeps restricted streets
      that cross *over* the highway from baking onto it. An empty baked
      list records a clean sweep, so silent legs are surveyed, not unknown.
- [x] **Destination exit offered a state early on rural-highway finishes --
      FIXED 2026-07-16 (player transcripts).** The destination-exit scan
      accepted the last labeled interchange anywhere on the route, so
      routes whose final legs are unbaked rural highways (US-281 into
      Lampasas, US-2 across the plains to Havre) crowned an exit hundreds
      of miles out -- worst case 1,158 miles, I-39 in Wisconsin for a
      Havre, Montana receiver -- and taking it settled the delivery from
      there. The scan now only accepts exits within the final 25 miles of
      the route and otherwise falls back to the synthetic end-of-route
      exit. Regression test pinned on both transcript routes.
- [ ] Bake labeled exits or junction cues for rural US-highway final
      approaches so arrivals there can name a real exit instead of the
      generic end-of-route fallback (follow-up to the 2026-07-16
      destination-exit fix; needs an OSM junction sweep over non-motorway
      trunk corridors). Scale, measured 2026-07-16 on this branch's data:
      533 of 1,287 legs carry no labeled interchange, and 192 of 623
      cities have none on any approach leg, so every arrival there uses
      the generic fallback. A seeded 2,489-route sample of supported
      routes found 44 percent previously misfired the destination exit
      by more than 25 miles (worst sampled: Payson, Arizona to Newport,
      Oregon, 1,152 miles early on a 1,420-mile route); all of those now
      take the fallback this sweep would upgrade. Regen should run
      offline from the cached PBFs like the overlay pipeline, targeting
      trunk/primary junction nodes on the 533 unlabeled legs.
- [x] **State truck speed limits audited against statute -- FIXED
      2026-07-20 (traced from a player report of "wrong" limits in
      California).** The reported limits were correct -- CVC 22406 caps
      three-axle rigs at 55 statewide -- but the table behind them came
      from a single aggregator and proved wrong on 4 of its 10 rows.
      All 50 states rechecked against statute text
      (`docs/truck-speed-limit-audit.md`): Arizona added at 65 (A.R.S.
      28-709) where it had been MISSING and 33 legs served the 75 car
      number; Oregon corrected 65 -> 55 (ORS 811.111(1)(b)); Idaho
      removed (repealed by H664, effective 2026-07-01); Nevada and North
      Dakota removed (never had a split -- their numbers had been lifted
      from the aggregator's *general* limit column).
      The table is now keyed by **road class** with a `default`, because
      Montana's 70-interstate/65-elsewhere split cannot be written as one
      number, and an explicit `maxspeed:hgv` tag outranks the statewide
      default but is trusted only as far as the statute permits -- that
      is how Oregon's tagged eastern corridors keep their real 65 while
      I-5 stays 55, without a stray 60 mph tag eleven miles inside
      California licensing an illegal speed.
      Deliberately NOT encoded, each for a stated reason: Illinois
      (real, but scoped to six Chicago-area counties and no county data
      is baked), Virginia (real, but secondary-roads-only -- a flat entry
      would cap I-81 at 45), and Arkansas's 50 mph off the
      controlled-access network (live law, but it uses a different
      vehicle test than the 70 provision and contradicts observed posting
      practice; needs ground truth from a driver who runs it).
- [ ] **Arkansas non-freeway truck limit: resolve the 50 mph question.**
      Ark. Code 27-51-201(c)(2) (Act 784 of 2019) reads 50 for trucks
      "in other locations", a 20 mph gap from what the game serves on
      Arkansas US routes. Not encodable from the statute alone -- ask a
      driver who runs Arkansas whether it is enforced.
- [x] **Interstate speed limits polluted by city-street samples at leg
      endpoints -- FIXED 2026-07-14 (found live by the owner on I-10).**
      The maxspeed bake's shield-match guard cannot fire when the
      interstate is outside the 400 m sample box at the mile-0/end city
      anchors, so a city arterial's 25-40 was baked onto the corridor
      and the step function held it for miles (I-10 out of Buckeye
      enforced 30 for ten miles; worst case 25 mph for 73 miles on
      I-84). Repaired offline, no Overpass needed:
      tools/repair_interstate_anchor_limits.py dropped every leading and
      trailing sub-45 sample on interstate legs (430 legs repaired, the
      step function heals back to mile 0), and the bake tool now skips
      shield-less sub-45 readings on interstate corridors so a re-sweep
      cannot reintroduce them. No re-bake needed unless we want denser
      urban 55/65 sampling later. Extended same day to surface highways:
      227 more legs dropped a city-street mile-0 anchor sample owning a
      fast corridor (US-60 out of Phoenix: 25 mph baked for 22 miles of
      the Superstition Freeway), honest small-town limits kept, and
      speeding enforcement gained a braking-grace window after any
      posted-limit drop.
- [x] **Cruise control now cancels on the player's own service brake
      (owner report, FIXED 2026-07-14).** Any service or emergency brake
      input drops cruise immediately and announces "Cruise off" -- the
      first tap of the pedal, like a real truck.
- [x] **Comma repeats the last spoken line, anywhere (owner ask,
      2026-07-14).** One global key re-speaks whatever said last -- menu
      item, readout, or road event -- complementing the driving-only A
      key. Text entry keeps its commas.
- [x] **G speaks the grade and the force verdict (owner ask,
      2026-07-14).** Slope, how far it runs, and whether the truck is
      holding it -- straight from the sim's net-force balance, including
      jake-holding and jake-slipping states.
- [x] **Overspeed dash warning (forum ask via JaceK's I-70 story, owner
      go 2026-07-14).** A few mph over the posted limit arms a spoken
      heads-up and a soft repeating dash chime -- carrier-style, exactly
      what a real company truck does -- quiet while actively braking
      down, disarmed by compliance, Gameplay settings toggle (default
      on). Chime is a deterministic procedurally-synthesized bell strike
      (vehicle/overspeed_chime.ogg, recipe in CREDITS.md). Answers "no
      clue I was speeding until I hit space."
- [ ] **Physics bench: add climb scenarios.** The bench covers descents
      and stops but nothing uphill; the 2026-07-14 climb audit (0-60
      loaded 66-69 s, 6 percent balance 29.8 mph, 3 percent balance
      44.9 -- all inside real envelopes) lived in a scratch script and
      deserves scenario status so regressions get caught.
- [ ] **Phoenix-metro interchange density is thin.** The interchange
      bake took (12 baked on the 40-mile Buckeye-Phoenix leg, speaking
      under the exits verbosity setting) but real I-10 there has 25-plus
      exits; metro legs deserve a densifying pass when the interchange
      bake next runs.
- [ ] **Overlong city-service routes from a bad geometry bake (proven
      in-engine 2026-07-14).** local_geometry.json carries 91 city-service
      chains over 10 miles (max 35.0), all single-segment with
      turn_level=false -- and the local_approaches fallback bakes the same
      broken distance, so the game really builds a 35-mile route at a
      blanket 25 mph to, e.g., the Tyler TX freight market, the Beckley WV
      freight market, and the Mankato MN garage (~80 game-minutes to run
      an errand). Yard/facility approaches are healthy (max 4.0 mi). Root
      cause is the dev-side build_local_geometry.py POI match picking a
      distant candidate and collapsing the failed turn-level route into
      one giant segment. ROOT-CAUSED 2026-07-14: two radii never
      reconciled -- build_city_services matches POIs within 28 crow-flies
      miles while build_local_geometry only routes within 18, so every
      sourced service in the 18-28 band is guaranteed to bake its full
      distance as one 25-mph fallback segment. Full execution spec for
      the re-bake (offline, local PBFs, no Overpass needed) lives in
      docs/rebake-briefs-2026-07-14.md alongside the dense maxspeed
      sweep brief; Opus executes both in a worktree.
      dozens of spider batches grow the map to 375 cities and 626 enriched
      legs -- real corridors across the Great Basin, the Hi-Line, the
      Dakotas, Appalachia, West Texas, and more, each with real roads,
      checkpoints, grades, and truck stops.
- [x] **Stable slug city keys.** Cities key by slug (`abilene_tx_us`) with a
      composed spoken layer, ending display-name collisions as the map grows.
- [x] **Truck-stop POI sweep and rural-diesel fallback.** Every leg now has
      a real or fallback fuel stop.
- [x] **Roadside landmarks and billboards.** 2,835 baked OSM landmarks speak
      as ambient chatter (national forests, named rivers, passes, museums),
      plus corridor-keyed parody billboards; a Settings group adds a master
      Roadside chatter switch with per-kind toggles, and terse verbosity
      mutes it all.
- [x] **Brand amenities at service stops.** Travel-center brands describe
      their real amenity sets in POI offers and rest-stop menus (the
      spoken layer of the amenities/Big Buck's modules).
- [x] **Real US time zones.** The compressed career clock now crosses real
      zone boundaries with spoken zone changes; deadlines read in the
      destination's local time.
- [x] **Service-stop buffs shipped.** Truck stops sell meals, showers, and
      rig care as spoken, clocked buffs: food eases fatigue and slows its
      build, lube bays and tire rotations slow engine and tread wear for
      the trip, brands behave by their real reputations (free shower with
      fuel at Pilot/Flying J, the Iron Skillet at Petro, tire bays at
      Love's/Speedco, road brake jobs at TA/Petro, Big Buck's fixes
      nothing), one buff per group with replacement, and none of it ever
      adds legal driving hours. The Big Buck's purchase-catalog gameplay
      still rides the drive-and-enter stop above.
- [x] **The 1.9 alpha test book.** `docs/alpha-test-book.md`: an
      exhaustive spoken-first delta chapter (everything the alpha changes
      versus the nightly line, system by system) plus setup / do / listen
      for / pass checklists for every non-physics 1.9 system -- wear and
      per-truck condition, truck-stop buffs and brand repairs, lanes and
      exits and ramp lights, congestion, surface streets and city
      services, enforcement and the logbook, pressure modes, the career
      arc, radio, world narration switches, saves and the integrity gate.
      The winter/physics suite stays in
      `docs/physics-playtest-checklists.md` as the companion volume.
- [x] **Scenario playtest levers.** Three environment variables put a
      parked career in position for a scenario without setup driving:
      `FREIGHT_FATE_FORCE_CITY` relocates on career load,
      `FREIGHT_FATE_FORCE_CLOCK` rolls the clock forward to a local hour
      (logged as off duty; a ten-plus-hour wait rests the driver), and
      `FREIGHT_FATE_FORCE_DEST` guarantees the dispatch board offers a
      load to a destination and puts it first in assigned dispatch. All
      spoken plainly, no miles or money moved, refused mid-load;
      documented in the test book Appendix A. The shared-profile event
      ledger must record forced moves when it lands (Josh's server side).
      SANDBOX BY DEFAULT (owner design 2026-07-15, after a lever run
      cost a real career $500): a lever session plays entirely in memory
      -- `save_profile` no-ops for the run, spoken as "Playtest sandbox:
      nothing this session is saved" -- and the career file resumes
      untouched; `FREIGHT_FATE_FORCE_PERSIST=1` opts one run back into
      permanence. Follow-up (shared with the driving school): gate
      online presence and the achievement journal during sandbox
      sessions so a sandboxed run never publishes real-looking events.
- [x] **Overlay re-sweep on the slug world.** The local-approach and
      turn-level geometry builders emit canonical world-key ids, and the
      city-service sweep now covers all 623 cities (1,869 services, 1,076
      turn-level routes) instead of the old 249-city batch. A 10-road-mile
      match cap keeps each city's freight market, garage, and truck dealer a
      real in-town errand rather than a ten-to-thirty-five-mile haul to a
      look-alike business in the next town. Fresh per-state OSM extracts are
      pulled by `tools/fetch_state_extracts.py`; the whole periodic re-bake
      is documented in `docs/refresh-city-service-data.md`.

- [ ] **Periodic macOS boot test (owner ask 2026-07-15).** The speech
      layer already plans for it (AVSpeech is the baked-in macOS event
      voice hint, Speech Dispatcher for Linux), but nobody has proven
      pygame + BASS + Prism boot on a Mac. Owner has a Mac Mini; run the
      smoke suite and a spoken menu walk there occasionally so the
      cross-platform seams stay honest.
- [ ] **Earcon audition pass.** The five 1.9 steering sounds (turn
      left/right/ahead, ramp light red/green) shipped verified by
      measurement, not by ear; regenerate any that sound off via
      `tools/generate_sounds.py` (+ `tools/mirror_turn_chime.py` for the
      right-turn mirror).
- [x] **Learn game sounds.** A catalog screen on the main menu and the pause
      menu: seven categories of road cue, each entry played on demand with
      the canonical name, what it means, and the setting that gates it.
      Ambience, music and self-explanatory sounds are excluded on the record,
      and a completeness test fails any new cue that ships uncatalogued --
      including the ones the game synthesizes at runtime rather than shipping
      as a file.
- [ ] **Sweep the catalog for cues that demo too quietly to hear.** The weigh
      station bed was fixed on its own report (Shane, 2026-08-15): it plays at
      the level the road plays it, which is deliberately low because it works
      by swelling under engine noise, so in a silent menu it read as nothing
      at all. Measuring every catalogued cue over the span the demo actually
      sounds put it at -33 dBFS against a catalog median of -21 -- and it is
      not even the quietest. "The road lean" (-38.5) and "Yawn" (-38.3) are
      lower still and nobody has reported them, so they were deliberately
      left alone rather than tuned blind. Worth listening through the whole
      catalog on headphones and deciding a floor, instead of waiting for each
      one to be reported.

## Shipped in 1.6.0

- [x] Realistic freight markets and facilities: metro route nodes now expand
      into hundreds of representative shippers and receivers, with stable
      facility IDs, ship/receive cargo roles, regional specialization, curated
      source notes, deterministic offline templates, and save-compatible
      facility-aware job generation.
- [x] Playable air-brake pressure mechanics: cold starts need a short air
      build before the parking brake can release, service-brake applications
      consume air, parked engine-off time bleeds reservoir pressure (issue
      #79), low-air and spring-brake thresholds are spoken, and active trip
      saves preserve the air-brake state.
- [x] Dedicated air-system audio assets: the compressor-ready cue now plays a
      real air-dryer purge (`vehicle/air_dryer_purge.ogg`) and the low-air /
      spring-brake warnings a low-air buzzer (`vehicle/low_air_buzzer.ogg`),
      both ElevenLabs-generated; the spoken cues are kept for accessibility.

## Realism and polish pass (1.7.0 shipped, 1.8.0 in flight)

A consolidation pass focused on closing realism gaps and removing rough
edges rather than adding new systems. Much of it shipped in **1.7.0**
(player-feedback UX, dispatcher pay advances, relaxed mode, grounded
hazards, drowsiness, truck-legal HGV routing); the 1.7.0 CHANGELOG is the
source of truth for that release's exact contents. The **1.8.0** batch --
shipped 2026-07-05 -- added the trooper pull-overs,
real OSM `maxspeed` baked per leg, corridor/real speed limits, seasons and a
temperature model, cargo-weight physics, immediate speeding-cost cues, the
S/A/U info keys, the HTML manual, and limit-aware (predictive) adaptive
cruise. Checkboxes below mark what is implemented; which release each lands
in is 1.7.0 or 1.8.0 per the split above. Several items overlap the trooper
milestone below (speeding consequences especially).

### Player feedback round (accessibility/UX)

From a batch of player reports:

- [x] **Driving keys did nothing under JAWS without JAWS Key+3 -- FIXED
  2026-08-24 (player report relayed by Norm, 1.8.8).** JAWS binds the
  arrows to its own scripts in every application, swallows the physical
  key, and re-sends it as an instant press-and-release pair, once per
  keyboard auto-repeat; driving polls `pygame.key.get_pressed()` and
  never saw a hold (menus react to the press event, so they worked).
  `held_keys.py` turns the pair train back into a hold, OR'd with SDL's
  own state so the physical-keyboard path is byte-for-byte what it was.
  Measured with `tools/key_probe.py` on Norm's JAWS machine the same day:
  first repeat at the Windows delay (512 ms), then pairs every ~250 ms
  (242-272) -- JAWS's script, not the 33 ms Windows rate -- so the
  tracker learns the spacing from the pairs themselves and sizes the
  hold to it; release reads ~370 ms late under JAWS, the price of a
  four-a-second poll.
- [ ] Under a key-re-sending screen reader a tap cannot be told from a
  hold until the first auto-repeat, so tap-length gestures (1.9's
  double-tap-and-hold pedal latch) are invisible through JAWS; a gesture
  counted in press events would see them. Second JAWS machine's probe
  log would confirm the ~250 ms spacing is JAWS-typical, not Norm's box.
- [x] **Rust port: the JAWS hold ported with the fix (2026-08-24, Noel
  Romey, PR #168).** `app::held_keys` carries the same pulse tracker, and
  every driving key reads through it because the port already polls its
  own held-key store rather than SDL. Three seams the port has and Python
  does not: the pulses only run once the app loop has begun a frame, so the
  playtest harness and the adversarial breaker -- which press keys straight
  onto the store with no clock -- keep the plain set-and-clear they always
  had; SDL delivers the keyboard's own auto-repeat as more presses of a key
  already down, so only a press from the released state can begin a pair;
  and the window losing focus is now an event the port raises, which drops
  every key so alt-tabbing away mid-drive cannot leave a pedal down.
- [ ] **Rust port: no key probe.** `tools/key_probe.py` measures the
  Python build's timing, which is the one players run today. A player on
  a Rust build who needs to show what their screen reader delivers has
  nothing to run, so the probe needs a port before the Rust build ships.
- [x] **Rust port: the window regaining focus never reached the screen --
  FIXED 2026-08-24 (found wiring the JAWS fix).** Python tests focus with
  its own `if` and the event carries on down the chain; the port turned
  that chain into a `match`, whose focus arm ate the event. Both screens
  that wait for a browser round trip -- online setup and the Mastodon
  link -- were silent on return, and the Mastodon screen never checked
  whether the link had taken. Focus now reaches the screen as well.
- [x] **Map screen read raw data keys for the route -- FIXED 2026-07-21
  (NVDA player report).** Its first line joined the world's city slugs, so an
  east-coast run opened with "new underscore york underscore n y underscore u
  s" for all thirteen cities; every other screen already composed spoken names.
  Same pass singularized spoken measurements ("1 mile", not "1 miles") on one
  shared helper. The reporter's snapshot also predated 36a7f8e, which is why
  the map listed the same shared-city facility twice and pushed real stops off
  the five-item list.
- [ ] Unresolved half of that report: stop lines on the Map screen "make the
  sound but not letting me fully read" under NVDA. Not reproducible from the
  code -- the list is built once, nothing under the menu updates, and no path
  interrupts or drops an utterance. Needs the reporter's `logs/game.log` from a
  snapshot newer than 2026-07-21 to tell "the game never spoke it" from "NVDA
  never spoke it"; packaged builds have always written that transcript, and
  Settings, Problem reports now tells a player where to find it.
- [x] **Destination exit offered a state early on rural-highway finishes --
  FIXED 2026-07-16 (player transcripts).** The destination-exit scan accepted
  the last labeled interchange anywhere on the route, so routes whose final
  legs are unbaked rural highways (US-281 into Lampasas, US-2 across the
  plains to Havre) crowned an exit hundreds of miles out -- worst case 1,158
  miles, I-39 in Wisconsin for a Havre, Montana receiver -- and taking it
  settled the delivery from there. The scan now only accepts exits within the
  final 25 miles of the route and otherwise falls back to the synthetic
  end-of-route exit. Regression test pinned on both transcript routes.
- [ ] Bake labeled exits or junction cues for rural US-highway final
  approaches so arrivals there can name a real exit instead of the generic
  end-of-route fallback (follow-up to the 2026-07-16 destination-exit fix;
  needs an OSM junction sweep over non-motorway trunk corridors). Scale,
  measured 2026-07-16: 533 of 1,287 legs carry no labeled interchange, and
  192 of 623 cities have none on any approach leg, so every arrival there
  uses the generic fallback. A seeded 2,489-route sample of supported routes
  found 44 percent previously misfired the destination exit by more than 25
  miles (worst sampled: Payson, Arizona to Newport, Oregon, 1,152 miles
  early on a 1,420-mile route); all of those now take the fallback this
  sweep would upgrade. Regen should run offline from the cached PBFs like
  the overlay pipeline, targeting trunk/primary junction nodes on the 533
  unlabeled legs.
- [x] **Loading a career cut off its own welcome -- FIXED 2026-08-05.**
  Continue latest career and Choose career spoke "Welcome back" and then
  pushed the city menu, whose own "Parked at..." announcement interrupted and
  cancelled it before a player heard where they were or how much money they
  had. Same defect as the 2026-08-05 orinks.net-offer fix (`8baae687`),
  applied to the load path via `CityMenuState`'s existing one-shot
  `queue_entry_announcement`.
- [ ] Same welcome-truncation defect remains open on two rarer hand-offs out
  of Continue/Choose career: resuming an in-progress pickup (`PickupFacilityState`,
  which still announces with `interrupt=True`) and a pending save notice
  (`SaveMigrationNoticeState` / `SaveModifiedNoticeState`, same default).
  Both would need their own one-shot queue flag, mirroring `CityMenuState`'s;
  left out of the 2026-08-05 fix as lower-value (the lost line is just the
  short "Welcome back, name" greeting, not new information) and higher-risk
  to thread through `_world_entry_state`'s snapshot-resume branches untested.
- [x] **State lines repeated at intermediate cities -- FIXED 2026-07-19
  (player transcript).** Mapped state-boundary cues are now authoritative, so
  passing the next major city no longer claims that the truck crossed the same
  state line again. City narration retains the old crossing wording only as a
  fallback for legacy legs without mapped boundaries. Full harness regressions
  cover Tennessee and Texas routes, reverse travel, and an all-Texas route.
- [x] **Terrain labels read real relief -- LANDED 2026-07-22 (nromey,
  PR #107).** Grade segments were labeled mountain from point steepness alone,
  so a single creek-crossing roller in flat country read as mountains in the
  status readout. Labels are now reclassified from the relief-aware sweep
  computed on the 1.9 line (18,638 false-mountain segments corrected
  network-wide, 166 leg summaries promoted, no curated corridor downgraded).
  Labels only; `avg_grade_pct` and everything physics reads is untouched.
- [ ] Reconcile checkpoint positions with state-boundary positions on seven
  corridor legs. A 24-route forward/reverse harness sweep found 13 places
  spoken on the wrong side of a state line: Fort Oglethorpe on
  Nashville--Atlanta; Peekskill, Newburgh, Kingston, Ravena, Rotterdam, and
  Amsterdam on New York--Buffalo; North East and Conneaut on
  Buffalo--Cleveland; Mesquite on Las Vegas--Salt Lake City; the Longview--
  Portland corridor checkpoint; Ashland on Portland--San Francisco; and
  Vernal on Denver--Salt Lake City. This is a route-data ordering issue, not
  another city-narration composition bug.
- [x] **Quick info keys.** S reads the posted speed limit (was buried in the
  Tab menu); A repeats the last route announcement; U reads what is coming
  up (imposed limits, stops, exits ahead); R answers "where am I" in two
  short sentences -- progress and distance left (to a planned stop when one
  is set), then the road, the state, and the city it is taking you toward.
- [x] **Stop details and planned stops (1.8.x nightly).** Enter on a Map-screen
  stop opens a job-details-style view (exit, distance, offers, parking, and an
  ELD-rule ETA with an arrive-before-your-next-HOS-limit note), with plan /
  cancel / supersede buttons. The planned stop is announced with a "Planned
  stop" prefix at every surface that names stops (5-mile exit announcement,
  U key, C-key next-legal-stop, Map screen), persists in the active-trip
  snapshot, and clears itself when taken or passed.
- [x] **Announcement priority and lead time.** Safety cues (zone entry,
  construction/traffic warnings, checkpoints) preempt ambient chatter on the
  event voice instead of queuing behind it; zone warnings lead by real time
  (scaled by speed and `time_scale`) instead of a flat 2 miles that compressed
  to a few seconds at highway speed.
- [x] **Construction-zone reaction window.** Shipped: construction-zone
  warnings now lead with "Brake now!" and arrive early enough at highway speed
  for normal service braking to reach the work-zone limit. Troopers also wait
  a little farther into the zone before clocking construction speeding, so the
  emergency brake can still save a late reaction.
- [x] **Directional lane-drift rumble.** Shipped: `AudioEngine.play` takes a
  `pan` argument (BASS `BASS_ATTRIB_PAN`, with a stereo-volume fallback for the
  pygame backend), and the lane rumble sets it from `lane.offset` so the strip
  sounds from the side you drifted toward. Follow-up if wanted: pan other
  lateral cues (e.g. a lead vehicle to one side) the same way.
- [x] **Consultable keys reference.** Shipped: the pause menu's "Controls and
  help" opens the navigable how-to-play reference straight to the driving-keys
  page (`controls_help_page()` + `HelpState(start_page=...)`), so the key list
  is reachable mid-drive instead of only the F1 firehose; the keys page now
  lists S/A/U. The manual is also exported to `USER_MANUAL.html` (a small
  dependency-free Markdown->HTML converter, `tools/manual_html.py`) and shipped
  in portable builds beside `USER_MANUAL.md`.
- [x] **Drivers board reachable from the pause menu.** The "Drivers board"
  item now sits in the pause menu (between Settings and Abandon job), so a
  player can see who is hauling mid-drive without quitting to the main menu.
  Viewing shares nothing about the paused driver.
- [x] **Metric units applied consistently.** The units setting converted the
  driving cues but not the dispatch board, job details, pay rate, departure and
  deadhead summaries, exit and hazard callouts, pickup distance, delivery
  summary, career stats, or the on-screen HUD, so a metric player heard
  kilometers on the road and miles everywhere else. All of those now go through
  the shared `units` helpers, and `sim.trip` delegates to them too rather than
  keeping its own copy of the conversion (one of which used a rounded factor)
  (PR #142).
- [ ] **Remaining imperial-only readouts.** Fuel is always gallons and a price
  per gallon, air pressure is always psi, and `weather.describe` omits the
  "Fahrenheit" that `season.py` says, so its temperature reads bare "degrees".
  Adding litres, bar/kPa, and a consistent temperature phrase is a feature
  rather than a units-setting bug, so it wants its own pass on the 1.9 line.
- [x] **Ambient-cue spacing (anti-stacking).** Shipped: priority handling fixes
  the critical case, and low-priority route chatter now has a short spacing
  window with one pending newest cue. Hazards, construction, checkpoints, pull-
  overs, and other safety events still speak immediately, while weather, tolls,
  state lines, CB chatter, and similar ambient lines no longer pile up in one
  burst; actionable GPS distances stay immediate.
- Confirmed-good: routing announcements through the SAPI event voice avoids
  contention with the player's primary screen reader; keep it the recommended
  default and documented.

### Driver economics

- [x] **Negative-balance recovery (softlock fix).** Shipped as a
  **dispatcher pay advance**: from the terminal hub or any in-trip rest
  stop, a broke driver (cash under $400) can draw $500 against the next
  load, capped at $1,500 outstanding, repaid automatically out of the next
  delivery settlement (never below zero, remainder carried). Tracked on
  `Profile.pay_advance`; deterministic and save-compatible. Money still
  goes negative freely for fines/tows by design, but broke-and-empty is no
  longer a dead end.
- [x] **Advances count toward lifetime earnings.** Settlement was crediting
  `total_earnings` with the post-repayment remainder, so advanced dollars
  were cash the career could not account for and cloud upload screening
  refused the save and stamped a sticky integrity flag. Lifetime earnings
  now book the whole settlement.
- [x] **Review integrity flags stamped before that fix.** All five production
  flags were cleared by hand on 2026-07-20. One (a level 2 career, four
  deliveries) was a false positive with no sign of an edit; the other four
  had been confirmed separately by offline forensics and were cleared as a
  deliberate amnesty.
- [x] **Stop screening from branding accounts on arithmetic alone.** A failed
  money or XP check now rejects the upload and keeps the payload for review
  instead of stamping a sticky flag that hid the driver until a human
  cleared it. Flags are still available by hand, from evidence. Both rules
  were wrong in the accusing direction: the XP ceiling was a copied 1.2 per
  mile sitting exactly on what a spotless career earns, and the money check
  priced owned equipment as if it had all been bought.
- [x] **Cloud screening reads the economy from the game.** Starting cash, the
  advance cap, and the XP rates ship in the exported invariants rather than
  being kept by hand on the server, so a balance pass cannot silently turn
  the rules against honest drivers.
- [ ] **Carry the same fixes onto the 1.9 line.** The career arc changes the
  XP model (flat per-delivery XP plus class, streak, and condition
  multipliers) and adds the owner-operator buy-in, where a driver takes
  title to a carrier tractor worth far more than the buy-in. Regenerate the
  exported invariants for save version 11 before 1.9 ships — the server
  gate matches on exact save version, so an un-regenerated export rejects
  every 1.9 backup.

### Fatigue and driver responsibility

- [x] **Drowsiness consequences.** Shipped: at severe fatigue
  (`FATIGUE_SEVERE`, 80+) the driver involuntarily nods off on a shrinking
  interval. Each microsleep plays a rumble-strip jolt with a short reaction
  window; steering or braking catches it (works with steering-assist off),
  but missing it drifts off the road for damage and scrubbed speed, and a
  third consecutive miss forces a stop. Independent of HOS mode (fatigue is
  physiological), so in relaxed mode -- where hazards are rare -- managing
  fatigue, fuel, and rest becomes the core of the drive. Possible follow-up:
  a dedicated microsleep/yawn audio asset instead of reusing the rumble strip.

- [x] **Coffee-break alertness tuning.** Shipped: food-and-coffee stops now
  ease fatigue enough to help you stay alert a little longer, while still
  staying much weaker than a 30-minute break and never satisfying the HOS
  break rule. Remaining balance follow-up: watch playtest feedback around
  night fatigue pacing and the gap between a quick coffee stop, a real break,
  and proper sleep.

- [x] **Relaxed mode should feel relaxed.** Shipped: `Trip` now takes a
  `hazard_scale` and relaxed mode passes `hos.hazard_scale("relaxed")`
  (0.2), so random road hazards are ~5x rarer while weather and night
  still modulate the ones that occur. Driver-responsibility systems
  (hours of service, fueling, repairs, fatigue) carry the relaxed loop;
  `realistic` mode is unchanged. Patrol windows already scale by
  `hazard_scale`; ambient traffic density (`_leg_traffic_density`) and the
  random roadside log-check odds (`_random_inspection_odds`) now do too, so a
  relaxed run is genuinely quieter on the road. Fixed weigh-station and
  construction-zone enforcement stay put -- a real violation still catches you.

- [x] **Grounded, context-aware hazards.** Shipped: the flat per-region
  string pool (which could announce farm equipment merging onto a freeway
  or a dust devil on a clear day) is replaced by a tagged `HAZARDS`
  catalog and `eligible_hazards(region, weather, terrain, hour)`. A hazard
  is only drawn when region, weather, terrain, *and* time of day all allow
  it: standing water/hydroplaning need wet weather; snow squalls, bridge
  ice, and shaded-grade black ice need snow; fog brake-lights need fog;
  crosswind and dust storms need high wind in open regions; rockfall and
  runaway-truck need mountain terrain; deer/elk are dawn/dusk/night-biased
  with regional species. Follow-up ideas: tie hazard *frequency* to
  corridor traffic density and proximity to metros; seasonal weather so
  snow is winter-only; condition animal strikes on rural vs urban miles.

### Driving feel

- [x] **Windows event-voice interruption crash (issue #85).** Urgent road
  alerts now use the speech backend's atomic interrupt-and-speak operation
  instead of issuing a separate SAPI stop immediately beforehand.
- [x] **Fair enforcement after lower speed signs (issues #80 and #87).** A
  driver who releases the accelerator now gets the braking time a loaded truck
  needs before a lower posted limit can produce a speeding strike. Continuing
  on the throttle forfeits the grace.
- [x] **Repeat destination-exit recovery (issues #84 and #90).** Every missed
  destination exit now reroutes the delivery back through a full approach
  window; the second miss can no longer leave the trip pinned at zero miles.
- [x] **Over-rev damage is now audible while it happens.** Sustained redline
  (easiest by backing up fast for a long stretch: the road-coupled RPM pins at
  `max_rpm`) silently ground the truck down 0.8%/s and only surfaced on the
  end screen (issue #62). The driving loop now plays the warning cue and
  speaks the rising damage total, repeating while it persists, with a short
  grace so shift flares stay quiet. Follow-up if wanted: a governor that cuts
  throttle at redline, and a reverse-speed cap, so sustained redline damage
  is hard to reach at all.
- [x] **Don't bind a controller when the controller setting is off.**
  `ControllerManager.__init__` opens the first pad unconditionally; with the
  setting disabled the game still enumerates and binds (issue #61: a fight
  stick got picked up despite controller-off). Gate `_open_first()` and the
  device-added hot-plug path on `enabled`, and open on `set_enabled(True)`.
- [x] **Verify the controller off/on toggle does not double button events.**
  Disabling now quits the SDL controller subsystem and re-enabling calls
  `init()` again mid-session, which the `_reopen()` docstring warns
  re-registers SDL's controller event watch so every event arrives twice
  (PR #67 review). Play-verified with a real pad (2026-07-12): several
  off/on toggle cycles in Settings, then button presses in menus -- no
  doubled events on current pygame, so no follow-up needed. If duplicates
  ever appear after a pygame upgrade, the fix is to make disable only close
  the pad and keep the initialized subsystem alive, reserving `_sdl.quit()`
  for `shutdown()`.
- [x] **Speed-dependent tire pitch and road-seam thumps.** Tire hum pitches
  up and down dynamically with speed on supported audio systems, with a
  distinct sound and controller pulse for road seams (PR #114).
- [x] **Gear / launch realism.** Shipped: gross mass is now
  cargo-weight-aware (tare + payload), so a heavy load accelerates slower,
  lugs on grades, and burns more fuel, and an empty deadhead is light and
  brisk -- the truck mass is no longer a flat 36 t. The low-speed launch now
  ramps into full drive-wheel traction instead of using the full rolling cap at
  a dead stop, and the automatic uses a slightly higher low-gear upshift point
  so a loaded tractor does not rush through the first gears before it is really
  moving. Tests pin the 0-20 mph and highway-speed envelopes so the truck feels
  heavier without turning sluggish.

### Speed limits and speeding

- [x] **Corridor highway speed limits.** Shipped: `speed_limit_at` now
  derives the open-road limit from `corridor_speed_limit(highway, region)`
  -- Interstate vs US highway vs state route, with rural Interstates faster
  out West (e.g. great_basin 80, southern_plains/rockies 75) -- and drops to
  an urban limit within `URBAN_RADIUS_MI` of a city. Changes are spoken as a
  GPS cue, zone-exit restores the corridor limit (not a flat 70), and the
  speeding check is judged against it.

- [x] **Real OSM `maxspeed`.** Shipped and baked: every one of the 438 legs now
  carries a `speed_limits` profile -- a step function of real posted limits from
  OpenStreetMap `maxspeed` (mph, normalized at build time) -- and
  `_corridor_limit_at` prefers it, falling back to `corridor_speed_limit(highway,
  region)` only where a leg has no baked profile. The urban-near-city reduction
  and the spoken limit-change cue are unchanged. The full bake produced 3,113
  samples (227 truck-specific `maxspeed:hgv`), correctly capturing Western 80 mph
  Great Basin stretches, California/Oregon truck-55/60, and Texas 85 mph.
  - Pipeline (local PBF, primary): `tools/build_interchanges.py --maxspeed`
    reuses the interchange reader to stream `maxspeed`/`maxspeed:hgv` off the
    corridor highway ways in local per-state Geofabrik extracts
    (`~/.cache/freight-fate-osm/regions/<state>-latest.osm.pbf`, auto-selected
    from the states each leg touches), snaps them to the checked-in OSRM
    geometry, and bakes a median-smoothed step profile. Its own index cache
    (`*.maxspeed.json`) keeps the interchange cache untouched.
  - Pipeline (Overpass, fallback): `tools/enrich_routes.py --add-maxspeed` does
    the same from the public Overpass API per route point when no local extract
    is available. Both are additive and idempotent.
  - `parse_osm_maxspeed` handles `"55 mph"`, bare `"55"` (assumed mph on the
    US-only map; OSM's km/h default is available via `default_kmh`), metric
    `"90 km/h"`, `"none"`/`"signals"`, and `;`/`,` lists (first general token
    wins). Unparseable -> `None`, so the heuristic stays the backstop.

  **Re-baking:** to refresh after a map change, run `uv run --group tooling
  python tools/build_interchanges.py --maxspeed --force --write` (per-state
  extracts auto-selected; `--only 'From->To'` for one leg). The bake is
  network-free (cached OSRM geometry or local route-point interpolation) and
  idempotent. The heuristic stays the backstop for any future leg OSM has no
  `maxspeed` on.

- [x] **Speeding leeway and consequences.** Shipped: when a strike is recorded
  (`_update_speeding`), the cab now speaks the running speeding-fine total
  immediately ("Speeding strike. The limit is 65. Speeding fines now total 160
  dollars, due at delivery."), and says when the fine has hit its cap, instead
  of the cost only surfacing as a silent settlement deduction. The leeway and
  hold window are now named constants (`SPEEDING_LEEWAY_MPH = 9`,
  `SPEEDING_HOLD_S = 6`) and judged against the leg's real OSM limit. The
  trooper milestone (below) remains the home for *visible, immediate*
  enforcement: getting pulled over and on-the-spot fines.

- [x] **Directional ramp advisory speeds.** The production local-PBF harvester,
  world schema, and Rust runtime path now preserve directional OSM
  `maxspeed:advisory` readings separately from the calculated fallback. The
  2026-08-26 national sweep matched 6,539 checked-in interchanges. Because
  ordinary advisory signs are generally passenger-vehicle guidance, a read
  value may lower but never raise the existing conservative truck target. No
  state-DOT or truck-rollover sign inventory is part of this first slice.

- [x] **Driving assistance presets and descent control.** Shipped for the current snapshot: Realistic, Balanced, All assists, and Custom coordinate optional lane, emergency-braking, stop-and-go, and interactive descent support without changing inherent adaptive-cruise behavior or simulation settings. Automatic exits, destination stops, yard entry, and docking remain deferred to Career 1.9 or later. On the 1.9 line, lane drift itself lives in the Driving assistance category but stays preset-independent like the speed keeper: presets tune warnings and support, never whether the lane task runs, so fresh careers keep the centered-lane accessible default.
- [x] **A hot ramp speaks one assist line, not two (2026-08-23).** The
      2026-07-15 logged playtest of the four 1.9 assists had curve speed
      assistance and route-transition assistance both firing on the same
      too-fast exit ramp. Cause found: a ramp adds 0.35 of curve weight in
      `driving_updates`, so the curve assist's heuristic branch engages on
      any exit over about 43 mph -- while route-transition assistance is
      already braking for the sign or the light and already says so. With the
      realistic preset both are on, so every hot ramp spoke twice.

      The ramp now owns the speech: the curve cue is suppressed while
      `_ramp_mi` is set, and the line that survives is the more useful one
      because it names WHAT it is braking for. Braking is untouched -- both
      assists still do their work. The release line is paired to the slowing
      line that opened it (`_curve_assist_spoke`), so a suppressed engagement
      cannot leave a lone "Curve speed assistance released." hanging with
      nothing before it, which is the obvious way this fix goes wrong and is
      pinned by its own test.

      STILL OPEN from the same playtest, and a different thing: the
      destination approach assist deliberately does not cover the ramp-end
      stop sign, so players can roll it with the assist on. That may deserve
      a clearer spoken hint. (The assist does stop at the arrival point
      itself, 2026-08-20; the sign at the end of an ordinary ramp is the
      terminal assist's job.)
- [x] **Speed keeper for low-speed zones.** Shipped: K starts a job-scoped speed-control session that uses the speed keeper on facility roads, in gate queues, work zones, and congestion -- where adaptive cruise is deliberately unavailable -- then automatically hands off to adaptive cruise on the open road, so players who cannot keep the accelerator held (or whose fingers tire) are not locked out of those stretches. It pauses through the planned pickup, persists through pickup saves, and resumes once the loaded truck is rolling. It restores the chosen cruise target across zones, follows queued traffic, and eases to ramp speed when the destination exit is announced before releasing control on the ramp. It fully disarms on other braking or hazards so it cannot restart unexpectedly. Preset-independent and on by default, toggleable in Settings, Gameplay.
- [ ] **Driving assistance presets and descent control.** Built and then withdrawn from the 1.8 nightly line after playtesting (the underlying assists need the 1.9 driving arc around them); the work lives on feat/career-1.9 and ships with 1.9. Release-merge note: the withdrawal was a git revert of merge 9b406fe (plus 9f2dbff and b971684) on dev, so merging feat/career-1.9 back will NOT re-apply this content on its own -- the release merge must first revert the revert commit on dev, then merge.
- [x] **Limit-aware adaptive cruise.** Shipped: once real OSM limits, zones,
  and trooper enforcement landed, plain "hold the set speed" cruise would carry
  the driver straight through an urban drop into strikes and pull-overs. Cruise
  now caps its target at the posted limit plus a small offset
  (`ACC_LIMIT_OFFSET_MPH = 5`, a with-traffic pace under the 9 mph strike
  threshold), brakes gently down to a lower limit, and announces once when it
  eases off. Still follows slower traffic and widens its gap in bad weather.
  Plus and Minus adjust the set point by `CRUISE_STEP_MPH` (the real
  Accel/Coast buttons), so you engage once rolling and dial the target up to the
  speed you want; the truck accelerates up to it, capped by the limit offset.
- [x] **Grade-aware adaptive cruise, and grades you can hear coming.** Shipped
  on the 1.8.x nightly line from a player report: cruise could only add
  throttle, so a downgrade carried the truck fifteen-plus mph past the set
  speed in silence and into a fine. `Truck.hold_throttle` now feed-forwards the
  grade under the wheels and P/I only trims from there; over the target cruise
  takes the engine brake and snubs the drums when that is not enough, holding
  the set speed on grades to eight percent with full air and cool shoes. It
  hands back only the engine brake it switched on itself. Alongside it, a
  spoken advisory for any grade of 3 percent or more lasting at least three
  quarters of a mile (short dips filtered out -- unfiltered, Knoxville to
  Asheville spoke 76 advisories in 116 miles), a once-per-grade line when
  cruise concedes the hill, and the G key for the slope under the wheels, its
  run, the truck's verdict, and the next grade ahead worth planning for --
  including a grade that steepens without flattening first, and the gentler
  pull the speed preview is banking momentum for, which the steep bar alone
  never mentioned.
- [x] **`tools/playtest_road.py`: drop into a chosen piece of road.** Built
  alongside the grade work, because walking the menus to a specific hill takes
  minutes and lands somewhere slightly different every time. Finds a road
  feature by evidence (`--find downgrade|upgrade|zone|limit-drop|stop`, with
  `--scan` to list candidates), then starts the real game already rolling at
  it with the truck, cargo, weather, hour, and cruise set as asked -- or
  `--headless N` for a speed/gear/jake/air trace instead of a window. Searching
  reads the world data alone, so `--scan` never opens a window. Its sibling
  `tools/playtest.py` still drives a whole delivery headlessly for transcripts.
- [ ] Follow-ups the dev line does not have: staged retarder control (dev's
  engine brake is one switch, so cruise holds by cycling it against the
  throttle rather than picking a stage), the predictive read of the grade
  ahead, and a pull downshift for climbs the automatic currently rides out in
  top gear. All three exist on `feat/career-1.9`; the merge takes 1.9's side.

- [x] **Window-model on-time bonus.** Shipped on the 1.8.x nightly line:
  `Job.payout` used to scale its on-time bonus by unused deadline (max 15%
  only for a near-instant delivery, a few percent in practice), which
  rewarded racing the clock and paid almost nothing for normal on-time runs.
  It now pays a flat 10% for any delivery inside the window, the way real
  shipper scorecards (OTIF-style) pay for service; late/damage penalties are
  unchanged. Compared against feat/career-1.9 before landing: 1.9's carrier
  pay plans add their own flat on-time share (2-6% of gross) plus reputation
  trust pay (max 6%) *on top of* gross, and its `Job.payout` is identical to
  dev's, so this reshapes the shared gross curve and merges cleanly; watch
  the combined stack (10% gross + carrier share + trust) when rebalancing
  the 1.9 economy.

- [x] **Tapered dispatch minimums.** The flat $700-1050 pay floors (clamped at
  the level-3 values forever) paid a 50-mile hop ~$23 a mile — four to five
  times any long haul — so grinding short hops was strictly optimal once load
  choice unlocked. `minimum_pay_for_level` now guarantees a short-haul rate
  premium ($4.70-5.50/mi by level, holding to 100 mi) that tapers linearly to
  $3.20-3.50/mi at 600 mi, where the untouched long-haul minimums (levels 4+)
  take over, plus a small $300-350 "worth rolling the truck" floor. Mid/long
  totals stay within a few percent of the old floors; only sub-~200-mi pay
  came down. Landed on dev and feat/career-1.9 together (1.9's
  direct-freight multiplier stacks on top, unchanged). Watch early-career
  cash pacing (rookie sub-150-mi jobs pay ~30-60% less; truck purchase
  timing may shift) when tuning the 1.9 arc.

### Realism north star (ongoing)

The guiding goal for 1.8 and beyond: make every system as true to real
trucking as the 2-D, audio-first design allows, short of a 3-D driving
model. New realism ideas land here, then graduate into a concrete slice
above when picked up. Existing items already serving this goal: grounded
hazards (done), corridor speed limits, gear/launch realism, drowsiness
consequences, and the trooper/enforcement milestone below.

Net-new realism candidates, roughly by area:

- [x] **Weather and seasons.** Shipped: the career clock now yields a day of
  the year and season, and `sim/season.py` models a regional temperature
  (seasonal + daily swing). Temperature reconciles the simulated draw --
  precipitation falls as snow when freezing, snow thaws to rain when warm,
  storms need warmth -- so snow is a cold-season risk and thunderstorms a
  warm-season one, and the weather-gated hazards inherit that automatically
  (winter ice/squalls, summer hail). Seasons are opt-in via `WeatherSystem`'s
  `game_hours` so seed-based tests stay deterministic; real-weather mode keeps
  driving conditions (and thus hazard context) from live data, and with live
  weather on the season follows the real-world calendar by default so it
  matches those conditions. Players can now turn off **Live weather controls
  calendar** to keep live conditions while the career date and seasons
  advance; established careers anchor that independent calendar to today's
  date at the handoff while new careers retain the March 21 start. A seasonal reconciliation guard prevents summer snow and
  cold-season thunderstorms in that mode. Real observation temperature is now extracted too (`_temp_to_c`
  -> `RealWeatherProvider.get_temperature` -> `WeatherSystem._temperature`), so
  live mode reports the station's real degrees and falls back to the climate
  model only when a reading is missing. Weather also bites mechanically now,
  not just as flavor: the per-condition aero `drag_mult` is applied to the
  physics (storms/wind cost top speed and fuel), driving well over the
  conditions-safe speed on a slick road risks a traction-loss incident
  (`_check_conditions_speed`), and low visibility shortens hazard reaction time
  (`_visibility_reaction_factor`). Freezing rain is now its own condition (see
  the 1.9 traction deep-dive above), so glaze ice no longer rides on active
  snow. Live-weather fog is now gated on the station's measured visibility
  (NWS "Fog/Mist"/"Haze" at 6+ miles played as pea-soup fog before).
  Remaining follow-ups: black-ice risk on clear cold mornings after wet
  roads (refreeze after the rain has stopped is still not modeled); steady
  crosswind nudging the trailer; and seasonal daylight length.
  (`_visibility_reaction_factor`). Remaining follow-ups: black-ice risk on clear
  cold mornings after wet roads (currently ice rides on active snow); steady
  crosswind nudging the trailer; and seasonal daylight length. Live-weather fog
  is now gated on the station's measured visibility (NWS "Fog/Mist"/"Haze" at
  6+ miles played as pea-soup fog before).
- [ ] **Live-weather staleness fallback.** If the network drops mid-trip,
  `RealWeatherProvider.unavailable()` still reports a city as available while
  its cache entry is stale (>30 min), so `WeatherSystem.update()` holds the
  last live condition indefinitely instead of falling back to simulated
  weather. Treat a stale-only cache as offline (and consider a spoken note
  when live weather falls back) so conditions can't silently freeze.
- [x] **Per-truck condition tracking.** Every owned truck now keeps its own
  fuel, damage, tire wear, and road grime (save version 5); newly bought
  trucks arrive fueled and fresh, and switching trucks no longer carries or
  loses fuel. Older saves are migrated automatically on load, with a one-time
  spoken notice that the save is no longer readable by older versions.
- [ ] **Teach the server-side validation gate and cloud-save consumers the
  `truck_conditions` shape.** The client invariants and docs are updated for
  save version 5, but the server plausibility rules still describe the flat
  pre-v5 condition fields.
- [x] **Mid-drive quit writes a self-consistent save.** Quit to main menu now
  rolls hours of service and fatigue back to the active-trip checkpoint the
  player will actually resume from, instead of persisting the shift accrued
  since the last stop (PR #146).
- [ ] **Close the same gap on the window-close path.** `App.shutdown()` saves
  the profile unconditionally, so closing the window mid-drive still writes the
  drifted hours of service and fatigue. Resuming re-restores both from the
  active-trip snapshot, so gameplay is unaffected, but the on-disk save and its
  cloud backup disagree with their own checkpoint until then.
- [ ] **Decide whether mid-drive money should roll back too.** Speeding fines
  and roadside fees deduct from the profile as they happen, so a mid-drive quit
  keeps money lost after the last stop while the position, hours, and fatigue
  all rewind to it. Either commit the charge deliberately or restore it with
  the rest of the checkpoint.
- **Physics and the truck.** Cargo-weight-aware gross mass is done for
  acceleration, grade lugging, fuel burn, and now braking: the foundation
  brakes have a fixed force ceiling sized for the rated gross, so loads over
  the rated weight are brake-capacity limited -- they stop longer and heat
  the brakes faster -- while loads at or below the rated gross are unchanged.
  Tire, brake, and engine wear over a truck's life shipped with the 1.9 rig
  wear system (wear accrues from how the truck is driven and feeds grip,
  brake force, fade onset, power, and fuel burn). Remaining: finer
  grade-based fuel burn.
- **Traffic and corridors.** Three slices shipped: rush-hour departure windows
  (morning and afternoon commute) raise modeled traffic density, especially on
  checkpoint/metro corridors, and can slow lead traffic packs with
  commuter/merge callouts. Random road-hazard check spacing now also follows
  corridor busyness: dense metro/checkpoint interstates check sooner, while
  sparse open-country corridors breathe more. Merge/exit pressure now marks
  exit lanes, route merges, construction tapers, and traffic packs with spoken
  gap cues and traffic-specific missed-exit recovery. Remaining: richer
  surrounding-vehicle behavior and multi-lane traffic choices.
- **Hours of service.** Split-sleeper provision and the 60/70-hour cycle
  with 34-hour restart (the HOS model intentionally skips these today).
- **Local delivery realism.** The checked-in map-data foundation now includes
  source-backed city-service POIs for every supported city, nearest-public-road
  local approach context for 2,395 of 2,401 service/facility targets, turn-level
  local street geometry for 412 city-service drives, and source-backed freight
  facility endpoints for 1,462 of 1,819 facilities. A bounded Midwest facility
  approach pass now road-snaps 71 high-confidence source-backed facility
  endpoints from Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio, with 6 long enough to use as
  turn-level playable facility approaches. These layers were built
  offline from the local Geofabrik PBF cache at
  `C:\Users\joshu\.cache\freight-fate-osm\regions\`; runtime remains offline
  and reads checked-in compact JSON only. Remaining: broader facility routing,
  true gate/yard/dock/driveway hints, private-entry validation, and first-drive
  city orientation routes. Player-facing text must continue to hide raw OSM
  IDs, tags, and source keys.
- **Business realism.** The grounded 30-level company-driver to independent
  owner-operator arc is shipped; true-authority depth, trailer polish,
  operating-cost tuning, and market pricing are tracked under Business.
- **Local delivery realism.** The destination-local approach legs already
  sketched under World: surface-street miles, gate speeds, and dock
  approaches after the highway portion.
- **Business realism.** The company-driver→owner-operator arc, loans, and
  insurance already sketched under Business.
- [x] **One message-review system, working on every screen.** The two
  overlapping histories (the app-level speech ring and the driving state's
  message log) are now a single bounded log; every review key -- step, jump to
  oldest/newest, filter by category, copy to clipboard -- is offered to each
  state by the app rather than wired into individual screens (issue #134).
  Remaining: an in-game review screen that lists the history rather than
  stepping through it one message at a time, and a player setting for how many
  messages to keep.
- [x] **National hub network fill (407 → 623 cities).** Audit-driven map
  expansion on the 1.8.x nightly line (community PR #68): every >10,000-pop
  independent city without a bigger neighbor within ~30 miles was built with
  the full enrichment recipe -- 1,287 legs, ~139,000 network miles, real toll
  events on the major turnpikes, and posted speed limits on every leg.

## Local city service drives (built for 1.8, releases with 1.9)

**Amended 2026-08-13:** the drive-to-location flow described below is
retired before 1.9 ships. The truck dealer now opens directly from the
terminal menu (see the 1.9 in-flight bullet above), reusing the same
source-backed `city_services.json` data for its name. Fuel, repairs, rest,
and food stay at truck stops and the terminal garage, as they always did.
The POI/approach/geometry data foundation below is retained for that
naming lookup even though the drivable route itself is gone.

The first ATS-style city-layout foundation is in: from the terminal, **Drive to
city services** lets the player pick the freight market office, terminal
garage, or truck dealer, drive a short local service route, stop at the
destination, and press Enter to go inside. This keeps the current terminal menu
available while moving city services toward a drive-to-location model.

- [x] **Source-backed city service POI foundation.** Every supported city now
  has three checked-in service roles in `city_services.json`: freight/logistics
  office, garage/repair, and truck dealer. The full-map bake used local
  Geofabrik-style state extracts from
  `C:\Users\joshu\.cache\freight-fate-osm\regions\` through
  `tools/build_city_services.py --all-supported`; runtime remains offline. The
  current data covers 194 cities and 582 service roles: 494 roles are
  source-backed from OSM and 88 truck-dealer roles are explicit fallback records
  with machine-readable fallback reasons. Source-backed roles carry coordinates,
  approach mileage, and road/context; fallback roles are not described as real
  POIs.
- [x] **Full-map local approach road context.** `local_approaches.json` is a
  checked-in build-time bake from the same local PBF cache plus world/facility
  data. It covers 2,401 approach targets: all 582 city-service roles have a
  nearest OSM public-road context, and 1,813 of 1,819 freight facility legs have
  nearest OSM public-road context. Six representative facility legs keep
  explicit fallback records because no usable road segment was found within the
  bounded search radius. Facility coordinates are still usually representative,
  so these are local-road approach contexts, not claims about real driveways,
  gates, docks, or companies.
- [x] **Turn-level local geometry subset.** `local_geometry.json` adds a
  source-backed local street sequence where confidence is high. The current
  bake covers all 2,401 service/facility targets with honest metadata: 412 of
  582 city-service drives have turn-level local street geometry from the local
  OSM PBF road graph, 170 city-service drives fall back to nearest-road context,
  and all 1,819 freight-facility records remain estimated fallback geometry
  because their endpoints are still representative metro-market facilities.
  This layer is not ORS `driving-hgv`; ORS HGV already powers corridor/highway
  route metadata where checked in, while this local batch stays rebuildable from
  local OSM extracts without hundreds of live directions calls.
- [x] **Local service driving phase.** City service drives use the existing
  truck physics, GPS/status surfaces, save/resume path, and spoken driving help.
  Arrival does not auto-open the menu: the truck must be fully stopped, then the
  player presses Enter to go inside.
- [x] **Accessible PDA/status wording.** The Tab status screens describe these
  as no-cargo local service drives, not `0 tons` freight loads, and F1/arrival
  prompts name the Enter-to-enter contract.
- [x] **Player/data docs.** The manual and freight-market data notes describe
  source-backed service coverage, explicit fallback behavior, and the rule that
  raw OSM tags, IDs, and source keys stay out of player-facing speech.

Follow-up hooks for the roadmap worker:

- **First-drive orientation route.** A new career can start with a short guided
  city tour that visits the garage, truck dealer, freight market office, and
  terminal services before the first dispatch. Keep it skippable/replayable and
  spoken as GPS guidance, not as a forced tutorial wall.
- **Turn-level local geometry.** Add ORS HGV or OSRM local geometry for
  the remaining sourced approaches so GPS can cue actual turns, lane changes,
  and final pull-ins instead of only source coordinates plus approach
  mileage/context. Runtime should still read checked-in compact data. The next
  routing-quality decision is whether to run a credential-gated ORS HGV local
  batch for selected service endpoints, self-host an HGV router, or keep
  extending the local PBF graph extractor with truck-access tags.
- **Facility-leg realism.** Replace representative freight-facility coordinates
  with sourced shipper/receiver, gate, yard, or driveway points where reliable
  local data supports them. Keep fallback reasons machine-readable and keep raw
  OSM tags, IDs, and source keys out of spoken/menu text.
- **Fallback reduction and data quality.** Keep extending the build-time
  classifier and optional operator-source inputs for the 88 fallback truck
  dealer roles, but do not invent dealers where OSM/operator data is missing.
  Keep bounded local extracts first, and only download the smallest missing
  state extract after reporting the absent path.
- **Enter-to-enter polish.** Add pull-in/park sounds and brief exterior/office
  transition cues when entering and leaving services. Keep the keyboard contract
  simple: stop, Enter to enter, menu action, Back/Escape returns to the truck or
  terminal stack with clear speech.
- **Freight market and trailers.** Trailer ownership/equipment matching belongs
  with a freight-market overhaul, not with the company-to-owner-operator career
  arc. A later slice can let the garage/dealer sell trailers, filter cargo by
  owned trailer capability, and show market sell prices at freight-market
  offices, while the business arc remains focused on driver/company vs
  owner-operator settlement and operating costs.

## Timed facility work and stop-menu settling (built for 1.8, releases with 1.9)

Pickup, loading, destination docking, unloading, and route-stop pull-ins now
feel like short in-game actions instead of instant teleports. Loading and
unloading speak what is happening, advance the career/HOS clocks as on-duty
work, and keep the player in a status screen for a brief real-time wait. Pulling
into pickup gates, destination gates, and route stops adds a short settling
buffer before the menu accepts navigation, so holding Down Arrow to brake does
not skip the first spoken option.

Follow-ups for a later facility/keyboard polish pass:

- [x] Let T open emergency shoulder sleep away from route stops, with one
  complete-stop threshold and an atomic brake-set handoff before menus freeze
  driving physics.

- [x] Offer the engine kill switch inside the pickup and delivery facility
  menus, and charge facility waits idle fuel at the road's rate so shutting
  down is a decision rather than decoration. Departing with the engine off
  names the start-up keys instead of announcing a departure.

- Let the driver set and release the parking brake themselves at a facility.
  Arrival currently parks the truck for them, which is what prompted the
  request (Jake, 2026-08-17); a menu row alone would be inert, so this wants
  the arrival gate to stop handing over an already-parked truck.
- Drive to the terminal after a delivery instead of being narrated there.
  `ArrivalState` settles the load and reports the driver parked at the home
  terminal; the empty-reposition trip type (`_settle_bobtail`) is most of the
  machinery a real post-delivery leg would need.
- Keep the future cargo loading/securing minigame optional and audio-first,
  with a simple timed loading path preserved for players who do not want an
  extra ritual at every dock.
- Give local facility approaches more distinct dock/gate identity: yard road
  names, gate lanes, backing distance, and receiver-specific arrival language.
- If key repeat is ever enabled globally, add an explicit post-transition input
  guard so held braking/navigation keys cannot leak into newly opened menus.

## In-cab logbook, Record of Duty Status (built for 1.8, releases with 1.9)

The game talks about an ELD and the shipped `TrafficStopState` already runs a
spoken "license/logbook check." That now has a real logbook behind it:
`DutyLog` records a rolling Record of Duty Status (RODS) as chronological
driving, on-duty, off-duty, and sleeper-berth segments with timestamps,
locations, and notes. The terminal and driving Tab status menu expose a spoken
Logbook screen, and traffic stops read the recent logbook summary before
resolving the warning or ticket. (The 60/70-hour cycle and 34-hour restart that
a RODS window would unlock are deferred to a later milestone.)

### Design sketch

- [x] **Data model.** A `DutyLog` of ordered `DutySegment`s: status (the existing
  `DUTY_STATUSES` -- driving / on_duty_not_driving / off_duty / sleeper_berth),
  start and end hour on the career clock (`profile.game_hours`), a short location
  string ("I-90 near Toledo", "Chicago terminal"), and an optional note ("fuel
  stop", "out-of-service order").
- [x] **Recording with coalescing.** `drive()` runs every frame, so the log must not
  append a row per tick. `DutyLog.record(status, start_hour, end_hour, location)`
  extends the current segment when status, location, and note match, and only
  opens a new one on an actual transition. A continuous driving stint becomes
  one row, on-ramp to rest stop.
- [x] **Architecture.** Keep `HosClock` pure and pygame-free (the headless tests
  drive it directly). The `DutyLog` lives on the `Profile` alongside `hos`, and
  is recorded from the layer that already knows the absolute clock and place --
  the driving/city/rest code that calls `_advance_rest_clock` and
  `hos.drive/on_duty/off_duty`. `DutyLog` stays unit-testable standalone. Prune
  to a rolling ~8-day window (192 game-hours) to bound save size.
- [x] **Persistence.** Additive `duty_log` field in `Profile.to_dict`/`from_dict`
  with a tolerant load like `HosClock.from_dict`; absent in old saves means an
  empty log. Fully backward compatible.
- [x] **Player surface.** A fully spoken Logbook screen (first-letter nav, consistent
  with the rest of the UI), reachable from the city menu and the driving Tab
  status menu. Shows current status, today's hours-in-each-status grid, the
  running limits the clock already computes, and a chronological list of recent
  segments ("7:00 AM-11:30 AM, driving, 4.5 hrs, I-90 from Chicago"). No new
  global hotkey needed -- C and Tab already cover live HOS.
- [x] **Real enforcement (first slice).** `TrafficStopState`'s logbook check
  reads the recorded RODS instead of only saying it performed a generic
  "license/logbook check." Future enforcement can cite deeper violations such
  as "11.5 hours driving since your last 10-hour reset."

## State troopers and law enforcement

Speeding, HOS/ELD compliance, and route enforcement are now one visible
system instead of unrelated end-of-trip deductions and generic random
inspections. The first shipped slice uses route-backed contexts where the
current corridor data supports them: weigh-station POIs, construction
zones, checkpoints/high-enforcement corridors, and seeded enforcement windows.
Events carry evidence such as HOS/ELD violations or construction-zone
speeding, and serious HOS violations trigger an out-of-service 10-hour
reset instead of only a fine.

- [x] **Speeding pull-overs and CB chatter.** Shipped: routes seed
  `PatrolWindow`s by highway class, region, and time of day (`Trip._place_patrols`
  / `active_patrol_at`), construction zones always hot, scaled down by relaxed
  mode's `hazard_scale`. A sustained speeding strike inside a window rolls
  against patrol intensity (`DrivingState._trooper_catches_speeder`); a hit lights
  you up (`events/police_siren`), you signal with X and brake to a stop, and
  `TrafficStopState` runs a spoken license/logbook check ending in an immediate
  on-the-spot ticket (`SPEEDING_TICKET_FINES`, paid now) or a warning; a prompt,
  fully-compliant stop has a small chance a ticket is waived to a warning. A
  behavior-based compliance tracker (seeded at `PULL_OVER_START_COMPLIANCE`,
  raised by braking, lowered by accelerating/coasting/failing to signal) judges
  the stop -- refusing to comply zeroes it out and is logged as an evasion/felony
  rather than the old distance rule. Disabled in the
  debug HOS bypass. Uncaught speeding still accrues the silent settlement strike.
  CB chatter now warns a few miles before drivers are talking about a bear or
  work-zone enforcement, plays `events/cb_radio_chatter.ogg`, remains
  non-critical so hazards and construction warnings can preempt it, and is
  reviewable with the U upcoming key. Real ElevenLabs audio is in:
  `events/police_siren.ogg` (pull-over),
  `events/spike_strip.ogg` (felony-stop sound on evasion), and
  `events/cb_radio_chatter.ogg` (CB chatter). Regenerate via
  `tools/generate_sounds.py`.
- [x] **Weigh-station bypass and unsafe-equipment stops.** Shipped:
  `DrivingState._check_weigh_station_enforcement` now gives a scale warning
  before open weigh stations, treats highway-speed blow-pasts as a roadside
  enforcement stop, and keeps the developer `debug_off` bypass. Severe visible
  truck damage now draws a safety stop when the truck passes an active patrol
  window. Both use `EnforcementStopState` for spoken reason, prompt-with-X
  pull-over flow, on-the-spot fine, and reputation hit without counting as a
  speeding ticket.
- [x] **Felony failure-to-stop escalation.** Shipped:
  `DrivingState._update_pull_over` now gives a failure-to-stop warning and a
  final warning before spike strips. If the player still keeps driving,
  `FelonyStopState` forces the stop, applies a larger fine, major reputation
  hit, spike-strip truck damage, three hours of enforcement processing time,
  and cancels the active loaded run before returning the player to the city
  terminal. Empty/bobtail runs do not claim a load was lost, and `debug_off`
  remains the internal enforcement bypass.
- [x] **Richer construction enforcement.** Shipped: construction zones now add a
  staged merge/flagger taper before the main work zone. The first cue remains
  action-first ("Brake now!") and tells the player to merge left for the flagger
  taper, slow to the taper limit, then hold the lower work-zone limit. The taper
  is a real speed zone for S/U/status surfaces, while ticket enforcement still
  waits for the main construction zone and its fair braking grace distance.

The ELD/HOS model is grounded in FMCSA's property-carrier summary:
11 hours of driving after 10 consecutive hours off duty, a 14-hour
driving window after coming on duty, a 30-minute break after 8 cumulative
driving hours that may be any non-driving period, and 60/70-hour cycle
rules with 34-hour restart as a future expansion. Primary references:
https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/regulations/hours-service/summary-hours-service-regulations
and https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/regulations/hours-of-service. ELD save data
records duty status, time, and route evidence in the spirit of FMCSA's ELD
function guidance: https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/hours-service/elds/eld-functions-faqs.

### Design sketch

- **Enforcement presence.** Each route leg gets an enforcement intensity from its
  region and highway (urban corridors hot, empty plains cold, construction
  zones always hot), modulated by time of day. The CB radio is the flavor:
  chatter about a bear ahead or enforcement near a work zone gives attentive
  players a vague spoken heads-up a few miles out.
- **Getting pulled over.** Speeding 10+ over inside a patrol's window (or
  blowing past an open weigh station at highway speed) triggers a siren behind you.
  The player must signal with X (reusing the exit system's muscle memory),
  brake to a stop on the shoulder, and sit through a spoken stop: license
  and logbook check, then a ticket, a warning (reputation and demeanor
  matter), or an order to a nearby weigh station for a full inspection.
- **Consequences.** Immediate fines replace the silent at-delivery
  deduction (escalating like HOS fines: 150 to 1,200 dollars), reputation
  hits, and an "out of service" order for serious HOS violations: 10
  hours parked where you stand. Ignoring the siren now escalates through
  spoken failure-to-stop warnings before a felony stop: spike strips, a huge
  fine, truck damage, processing time, and active loaded-run cancellation.
- **Settings.** HOS defaults to realistic and keeps relaxed for
  accessibility and pacing. There is no player-facing non-enforced mode:
  enforcement-off survives only as an internal developer bypass
  (`debug_off`), and legacy 1.5.0 "off" saves now load as realistic. A
  separate law-enforcement setting remains open only if enforcement grows
  beyond HOS and route safety evidence.
- **Audio needed.** Siren approach/behind loops, CB radio squelch and
  chatter, an officer voice channel (the SAPI event voice fits), spike
  strip. Added as Ogg Vorbis assets under
  `src/freight_fate/assets/sounds/`.
- **Open questions.** Do warnings expire after a clean stretch? Does reputation
  lower the ticket odds, or just the fine? Should repeat felony stops affect
  future dispatch availability?

      load cancellation shipped; future repeat-offender dispatch hooks remain)
- [ ] Special event jobs (oversize loads, urgent medical freight)
- [ ] Trailer types with handling differences
- [ ] **In-game driving school (owner-approved 2026-07-14; skeleton
      SHIPPED 2026-07-15).** Landed: the Driving school terminal item, the
      sandbox architecture (lessons run the real driving engine on a
      throwaway profile copy -- wear, money, and hours die with the
      lesson; one save_profile guard keeps it off disk; every exit path
      restores the career), the 25-mile flat practice road, and Lesson 1
      "Rolling basics" (engine, air, parking brake, roll to thirty,
      smooth stop) as an instructor riding the first-run tutorial's
      hooks. Remaining below. A CDL-style
      spoken tutorial mode: guided lessons for air brakes, shifting and the
      jake, exits and lanes, chain-up, and hours of service, each teaching
      by doing in a consequence-free practice drive. Solves cold-start
      onboarding for alpha and new players -- today the game teaches via
      How to play, F1 key help, and the test book; every system learned by
      book there is a candidate lesson here. Curriculum effectively drafted
      by the 2026-07-14 learn-by-test-book session (test book Chapter 4
      leads). Pairs naturally with the lease-to-start onramp: school first,
      then the working career. Owner-expanded 2026-07-15: lessons run on a
      simulated practice road (spoken instruction, no career consequences)
      with weather sim and, when the curve tier lands, curve lessons;
      school is enterable from anywhere, any time; buying a truck with new
      equipment (jake stages, assists, a manual box) offers a
      return-to-school refresher on the new bits. Build it as a complete
      presentation for Josh -- done, tested, preset-integrated -- and he
      decides if it ships.
- [ ] **Assists as equipment and skill at the realism tier (owner idea
      2026-07-15, the transmission pattern applied).** At the realistic
      preset, driving assists become what they are in a real cab: truck
      equipment by model year and spec (a new tractor carries AEB and
      lane centering; a lease-starter rig carries nothing) plus trained
      skill from driving school. The Settings presets stay exactly as
      built -- the permanent, free accessibility override that always
      wins, same as the Transmission setting over per-truck gearboxes
      (owner-approved precedent 2026-07-13). Realism players feel the
      equipment; accessibility players keep every accommodation; Josh's
      framework becomes the front door to both layers.
- [x] **Latching controls -- SHIPPED 2026-07-15.** Double-tap-and-hold
      on the pedal keys (tap, press again, hold half a second) latches
      the accelerator or brake hands-free, exactly the owner's gesture
      design: a catch click (ui/tick placeholder until the NAS sound
      pass, distinct from the gear click) plus "Throttle latched.",
      release by a single press of the same key or instantly by the
      opposite pedal, all spoken both ways. Safety semantics as
      designed: hazards (including AEB), the emergency brake, and the
      overspeed alarm outrank a latched accelerator and drop it
      audibly; microsleeps deliberately read the RAW keys, so a latched
      brake never answers a nod-off for you; a latched brake reads as
      held everywhere else (reverse gesture, cruise cancel). Lives in
      Settings, Driving assistance, as "Latching pedals", on by
      default, outside the presets like the speed keeper. Follow-ups:
      swap the catch click for a proper cab sound from the NAS library,
      and the driving-school lesson that teaches latch + jake + brake
      heat together (school-curriculum bullet).
- [x] **Throttle latch removed -- 2026-08-28.** Players did not use
      the throttle latch, and it still fought getting out of reverse
      after the 2026-08-21 reverse-trap patch. Holding the throttle
      key never catches a latch: no spoken line, no click, no cruise
      or keeper variant. Brake latch remains as Settings, Driving
      assistance, Latching brake, on or off.
- [ ] **Credentials earned by coursework, not just cash (owner idea
      2026-07-15; half arrived with the 2026-08-30 credential ladder).**
      Hazmat now EXISTS -- course fee, game-time dwell, and the real
      TSA-style background wait in game days before it activates -- but
      every course is still money plus time with no learning in it. The
      remaining piece: route courses through the driving school as a
      spoken written-test module (study material read aloud, then a
      short question set to pass; hazmat's would cover placarding and
      segregation). Also still open: company drivers taking sponsored
      courses on the carrier account instead of their own wallet, and
      hazmat ROUTE restrictions -- the map's baked restrictions are
      only low-clearance and weight, so tunnel bans for placarded loads
      are a data layer that does not exist yet (the old claim that the
      map bakes them was wrong).
- [x] **Endorsement grants must be heard, not missed -- CLOSED
      2026-08-30 with the credential ladder.** Every grant now queues an
      `unacknowledged_grants` repeat spoken at the next terminal entry,
      cleared background checks are announced at the terminal and at
      arrival, and an unlocked specialty job's detail screen says
      "Cleared for it: you hold ..." -- permanently, not just the first
      few times. The Career stats screen lists held credentials by tier
      plus every check still in progress with days remaining.

### World
- [x] More cities and regional highways (1.4.0)
- [x] Day/night cycle with audio shifts (1.5.0); seasons and a regional
      temperature model now shipped too
- [ ] City-specific ambience and landmarks
- [ ] Destination-local facility legs: after the highway trip reaches the
      destination city, hand the player onto a short local approach to the
      receiver gate. Route display and GPS cues should clearly separate
      highway miles from local gate approach, saves should resume on the
      correct leg, and facility data should carry enough road name, distance,
      gate speed, and dock-approach detail to make warehouses, terminals,
      ports, and industrial yards feel distinct.
- [ ] **Locally-2D world: crossing axes instead of one route line (owner
      musing, 2026-08-20).** Today the sim is one-dimensional -- the route is
      a line and every NPC lives on it. The cross bubble (yield design above)
      is deliberately the first second axis: a short simulated stretch of
      crossroad, spawned where it matters and despawned after. The same shape
      scales without an engine rewrite: N crossing axes at named points --
      ramp terminals, facility approach chains, in-town errand grids -- each
      a small 1-D sim of its own, joined at conflict points. "2D where you
      stand, 1-D where you drive." A fully routable 2D street network stays
      out of scope until the axis model runs out of road; if it ever does,
      the OSM graph the bakes already walk is the substrate a real network
      sim would read.
- [ ] International expansion, beginning with research into Canada and the
      United Kingdom: country profiles need driving side, units, currency,
      local trucking terms, hours-of-service rules, weather fallbacks, legal
      routing, and border-crossing behavior before routes can ship.

### In-cab radio (1.8 / 1.9 candidate)

A truck radio you can tune as you drive: pull in the local FM stations for
wherever you are on the map, with a satellite-style network as the
always-available fallback when you are out of range of anything local. A
community suggestion; the right kind of immersion for long hauls and a natural
fit for an audio-first game.

- [x] **Practical in-cab radio.** Shipped: driving now has keyboard radio
  controls (M toggles, brackets tune, Y speaks status), persistent radio
  enabled/station/volume settings, a dedicated lower radio volume, streamer-safe
  mode on by default, real public streams gated behind explicit opt-in, and
  graceful fallback when a selected station/backend cannot play. The checked-in
  JSON catalog includes safe built-in stations, AFN Pacific, multiple AFN Go
  choices (Freedom, Gravity, Country, The Voice, and Okinawa Eagle), and a curated
  regional public-station subset across the current map. The truck estimates its
  lat/lon from checked-in route geometry and city coordinates, bracket tuning
  walks only the currently receivable stations, and the Tab status menu has a
  Radio screen with signal/fallback/source/volume details. External live streams
  are still metadata-only until a non-blocking stream backend is added; opt-in
  stations fall back safely instead of hanging or crashing. Remaining: FCC-derived
  contour/range refresh, station favorites/presets beyond the review list,
  audible static/signal fades, and actual external stream playback once the
  backend can do it without stealing priority from speech and safety cues.

- **Direction (decided):** use real stations via their public internet stream
  URLs (a friend has a curated list). The game is free and non-commercial, and
  it acts as a *tuner* -- it points the player's own client at a stream the
  station already broadcasts publicly, not hosting or rebroadcasting audio
  (the TuneIn / car-head-unit model). Free and non-commercial is not a blanket
  copyright exemption, but the tuner-to-public-stream posture plus no money
  changing hands keeps practical risk low for a small game.

- **Streamer-safe toggle still required.** Independent of the game's own
  posture: a player who streams a session to YouTube/Twitch with copyrighted
  station audio can still get the VOD struck. So real-stream radio stays an
  explicit toggle (and a "mute radio for streaming" switch), with an owned
  royalty-free station and the satellite fallback as the always-safe default
  audio, so streamers are protected unless they opt in.

- **Geography-gated reception.** Stations are data, not magic: a JSON catalog
  per station with call sign, format/genre, public stream URL and its audio
  format (so the loader can skip unsupported transports), transmitter
  latitude/longitude, ERP (effective radiated power), and antenna HAAT, plus a
  derived `range_miles`. Range is estimated from public FCC license data (FM Query /
  LMS) using the F(50,50) protected-contour idea -- power and antenna height,
  refined by terrain -- so you can only pull in stations whose coverage
  actually reaches you. The truck's geo-position is interpolated in
  latitude/longitude along the current route leg (cities already carry
  lat/lon), signal strength falls off toward the edge of a station's contour,
  and reception fades into static and drops out as you leave range -- then the
  next town's stations fade in.

- **Satellite fallback: AFN.** An always-available station for when no local
  FM is in range -- AFN (American Forces Network), which has exactly the right
  always-on, ad-free, slightly-institutional vibe. AFN's *overseas over-the-air
  and decoder-box* broadcasts are encrypted, but its internet radio (AFN 360)
  is publicly streamable to anyone, so it can be used directly. Public stream
  URL (Triton/StreamTheWorld, AFN Pacific):
  `https://playerservices.streamtheworld.com/api/livestream-redirect/AFNP_OKN_SC`.
  AFN is ad-free and U.S. government-produced, but the music it airs is still
  commercially licensed, so the streamer-safe toggle still applies to it. This
  is the one station that is always in range, so it doubles as the graceful
  fallback when a local stream rots or drops out.

- **Audio sourcing: real streams, with the real work being technical not
  legal.** The friend's stream-URL list is the primary source. The gotchas to
  build around: (1) streams rot -- URLs change and stations go dark, so
  reception must fail gracefully and fall back to the satellite/owned station,
  never dead air or a crash; (2) codec/transport -- the BASS/sound_lib backend
  handles Icecast/Shoutcast MP3/AAC easily, but HLS (`.m3u8`) needs more work,
  so the catalog should record stream format and the loader should skip
  unsupported ones; (3) some stations geo-block or require their own app, so a
  few URLs won't work for a third-party player and the catalog needs a
  reachable/working flag. Keep an owned royalty-free station and the satellite
  fallback for offline play and the streamer-safe default.

- **Accessibility is the feature, not a checkbox.** Tuning must be fully
  spoken and keyboard-driven: seek/scan up and down the dial, announce call
  sign + format + signal strength, audibly fade as you move in and out of
  range, a station list and favorites, and a dedicated radio volume in
  Settings. This is core UX for the game's audience, designed in from the
  start.

- **Ties to existing systems.** Reuses regions and city lat/lon, the music
  backend, and the day/night + seasons clock (programming could shift by time
  of day or season). Open questions: ship the full FCC-derived dataset or a
  curated subset; how granular the range/terrain model needs to be; and
  per-genre licensing for any owned music library.

### Business
- [x] Company-driver to owner-operator career arc. Full first arc: choose among
      grounded fictional company-driver starter carriers with
      carrier-assigned equipment, carrier-paid fuel/repairs, and different
      wage, dispatch, route-mix, and freight tradeoffs; progress through 30
      ranks; then unlock a
      level-18 leased-on owner-operator path with a buy-in,
      working-capital gate, owned-tractor garage access, higher gross revenue,
      and operating-cost deductions. A higher-risk owner-operator start is also
      available for experienced-driver fantasy play. Level-21
      owner-operators can now set aside an authority prep reserve, then unlock
      a limited level-25 own-authority direct-freight mode once the final gates
      are met. Levels 26-30 add established independent owner-operator ranks.
      Loans, full paperwork simulation, and fleet ownership remain future work.
- [x] Trailer program and cargo compatibility slice. Cargo now maps to dry van,
      reefer, flatbed, or bulk trailer programs. Company drivers keep
      carrier-provided trailers. Leased-on owner-operators start with dry van
      access and can add specialty trailer programs from the garage; missing
      programs lock matching loads with clear dispatch-board text.
- [x] Own-authority trailer ownership slice. Own-authority drivers can buy dry
      van, reefer, flatbed, and bulk trailers from the garage. Matching direct
      freight rows say when an owned trailer fits, and settlement uses a smaller
      owned-trailer reserve instead of the trailer-program charge.
- [x] Trailer-fit dispatch preview slice. Dispatch rows now mark trailer-setup
      locks before the player accepts a load and show an estimated driver pay
      or take-home preview based on the current carrier, business status, and
      owned/program trailer setup. This is a readable offer preview, not a full
      spot-market or resale model.
- [x] True authority and direct freight first slice. Prepared owner-operators
      can activate own authority from Business status after delivery,
      reputation, cash, trailer-program, and advance-clearance gates. Dispatch
      then marks loads as direct freight with higher gross revenue, and
      settlement adds insurance, compliance, trailer, truck, and factoring
      overhead. This is not a full DOT/MC paperwork or broker contract sim.
- [ ] Advanced authority realism. Build on the current own-authority state with
      richer insurance filings, DOT/MC application timing, broker/load-board
      access tiers, factoring or delayed settlement choices, and clearer
      compliance overhead.
- [ ] Advanced trailer ownership and leasing. Build on the current owned
      trailer model with condition, financing, resale, tanker cargo, washout,
      and richer authority-specific cargo-fit choices.
- [ ] Operating-cost polish. Continue tuning owner-operator deductions against
      real cost categories such as fuel, maintenance reserve, insurance, truck
      payment, trailer program, and settlement/factoring fees, while keeping
      settlement speech short and understandable.
- [ ] Freight-market pricing realism. Continue separating company-driver wages,
      leased-on gross revenue, and own-authority spot or broker rates; expand
      direct freight board comparisons with better lane-rate inputs, fuel
      estimates, and trailer condition once those systems exist.
- [ ] Business realism caveats. Keep lease-purchase risk visible as caution,
      not the golden path. Avoid payday-loan-like traps, and keep fleet hiring
      separate from the driving-career loop.
- [ ] Equipment model polish. Legacy profile fields still preserve `truck` and
      `owned_trucks` for save compatibility, but company-driver UI hides them
      behind assigned-equipment helpers. A future schema pass can rename those
      internals once older saves have a migration path.
- [ ] Company ownership: hire AI drivers, buy trucks
- [ ] Loans and insurance

### Platforms and community
- [x] Binary releases (Nuitka) per platform
- [ ] Steam/itch.io distribution
- [ ] Localization of all speech strings
- [ ] Optional online leaderboards
- [x] Opt-in Profile sharing for fictional road journals, achievements, and last-saved profile summaries
- [x] Account-wide achievement collection with a read-only, category-based Online menu browser, plus spoken notice when automatic ten-career cloud retention removes the least recently played cloud backup without deleting the local career
- [x] Online posts carry the game's build identity (release tag or source checkout) so moderation can tell which version a driver runs
- [x] Validated and server-signed private cloud revisions with verified public profile summaries
- [ ] Richer verified driver profiles: identity headline (level title, business
      status, carrier, rig), a rates-first resume (lifetime deliveries and
      miles, on-time and damage-free percentages with a minimum-deliveries
      floor, clean-inspections-vs-citations safety record), traveler stats
      (states and cities visited, longest haul), the two or three most recent
      badges, and net worth (cash plus equipment) labeled by business status.
      One fact per spoken line, identity first; keep XP, fatigue, HOS state,
      and dispatcher standing private.
- [x] Profile integrity, client half: `profile_invariants.py` runs the hard, version-stable sanity rules (ranges, counter relations, upgrade tiers) as defense in depth behind the Ed25519 signature on every cloud restore, refusing with a plain spoken reason; `docs/profile-invariants.md` is the maintained validation list for the server gate. Follow-up: the append-only event ledger that upgrades server validation from plausibility to recomputation
- [x] Packed save container: careers live in signed `.ffsave` files (magic header + deflated JSON) that text editors cannot open; legacy plain-JSON saves convert on load with a `.json.bak` rollback copy. A failed local signature now marks the profile `integrity_modified` (sticky, signed-in, spoken once) instead of quarantining — local play continues, shared features read the mark. `tools/dump_save.py` prints the JSON inside a save for bug reports.
- [ ] Retire legacy plain-JSON save loading (and its unsigned amnesty) once converted installs are the norm — one or two releases after the container ships; the amnesty is the last casual editing door
- [ ] Ship a stable release carrying the packed save container, so players are not split across two save formats. Until one exists, a career backed up from a developer snapshot cannot be restored onto 1.8.3: the snapshot writes the newer format, and the stable build drops the fields it does not recognise. Moving forward (stable career onto a snapshot) is fine. Fixing the backwards direction in the client was considered and deliberately declined — too many edge cases for the value; the stable release is the fix. Told players so on issue #97, without naming a date.
- [x] Cloud backup accepts every shipped save shape, not just the newest build's: the orinks.net validator matches uploads against a superset allow-list and a supported version range, and only requires the fields it actually reads. It had demanded an exact match with whichever build the invariants export was last generated from, which refused newer and older saves in turn — most recently every save from 1.8.3, the stable release, leaving those players unable to back up at all (issue #97)
- [ ] Server absolution for `integrity_modified`: a profile that passes full server validation may have the client mark cleared on the next verified restore, so honest cross-machine movers are not marked forever (`docs/server-integrity-handoff.md`)
- [x] Driver token in the platform secret store: the secret half of the online credentials goes to Windows Credential Manager, the macOS Keychain, or Secret Service/KWallet on Linux via `keyring`, leaving only the public Driver ID in `online.json`. Tokens written by earlier builds migrate on the next load, with no re-paste. A machine with no working store (headless Linux) falls back to an owner-only `online.token` opened at 0600 (community PR #133, reworked cross-platform)
- [ ] Sign out from inside the game: there is no way to unlink a computer from the game side, so the stored token outlives an uninstall. Needs a Cloud/Online menu action that clears `online.json`, the secret-store entry, and any fallback token file, plus the corresponding revoke on the orinks.net computer list
- [x] Per-computer driver tokens on orinks.net: each computer gets its own token from a named, revocable computer list on the driver setup page, so connecting a second computer no longer retires the first one's sign-in (issue #64; game-side reconnect guidance points at the computer list)
- [x] Copy the delivery summary to the clipboard from the delivery complete screen (verified by read-back before the game says "copied")
- [x] Delete a career's cloud backups from the Cloud backup menu: a confirmed, safe-default-first delete removes every kept revision from the account (server DELETE route + existing `deleteSaveSlot` mutation); local saves untouched, sync state forgotten so a still-local career starts a fresh slot on its next save
- [x] Choose the public career from the Cloud backup menu: one designated career fronts the public profile (`publicSaveName` on the driver row, spoken "your public career" in the backup list, confirmed switch per career), and every other career stays a private cloud backup -- ending mixed public stats when several careers back up. Accounts that never choose keep the old first-uploaded-owns rule; the empty-cloud sticky conflict that silently stopped backups after a server-side wipe or remote delete heals itself on the next save
- [x] Opt-in Mastodon sharing of notable deliveries: the player links their own Mastodon account on orinks.net (any instance, dynamic app registration, `read:accounts write:statuses` scope), and the game offers deliveries that earned an achievement, level, or streak milestone; the server composes the public post from allowlisted facts and adds the #FreightFateRuns hashtag (deliberately not the bare #FreightFate, which players use for their own posts -- muting the bot must not mute the conversation). Off by default, separate consent from Profile sharing, durable outbox client-side
- [ ] Mastodon sharing follow-ups: unlink from inside the game (today the orinks.net page is the only unlink), and consider per-post visibility choice (public vs unlisted) if players ask
- [x] Activation-code setup replaces clipboard-paste credentials: connecting
      a computer to orinks.net now shows a short activation code (spoken,
      spellable phonetically, and copyable to the clipboard) instead of
      requiring a Driver ID and token to be copied from the website and
      pasted into the game; the game polls and finishes connecting on its
      own once the code is confirmed in the browser (`online_activation.py`,
      device-code exchange already live on orinks.net)
- [x] First-career onboarding offer: creating a first career now offers,
      once, to connect the computer to an orinks.net account -- right after
      "Welcome aboard" and before the dispatch board (`states/online_offer.py`,
      gated by the per-install `Settings.online_offer_seen`, never asked again
      once seen or once a computer is already connected). Declining (or
      Escape, which behaves the same) and accepting both continue straight
      into the city menu either way. The offer says exactly what connecting
      does, which since the change below is turn Profile sharing and cloud
      backup on.
- [x] Connecting an orinks.net account turns Profile sharing and cloud backup
      on, instead of leaving both off behind their own separate yes: the
      public career statistics are derived from the latest accepted backup,
      so a connected account with neither switched on left every new driver
      staring at a profile that read "no career statistics yet". Cloud backup
      needs no handshake and starts immediately; Profile sharing waits on the
      server confirming it, exactly as the standalone toggle does, and a
      refusal keeps the connection and names the retry rather than sending
      the player back for a fresh activation code. Setup disclosure, the
      first-run offer, the Online menu help, and the manual all say so up
      front. Players already connected are untouched -- nothing they left off
      turns itself on at upgrade.
- [x] Idle drivers age off the live board: a truck parked with the game left running (not paused) signs off after 30 minutes without a snapshot change and stops heartbeating (`online_presence.py` IDLE_SIGNOFF_S); the server hides still-beating idle rows on the same clock for older builds (orinks-net `PRESENCE_IDLE_MS` + per-row `changedAt`), and deadhead presence now carries progress so a long empty run never reads as idle
- [x] Online hub: the drivers board, orinks.net account, cloud backup and restore, and all sharing toggles moved from Settings into one Online menu on the main menu (`states/online_hub.py`); Settings keeps an Online pointer that opens the same menu for a release or two
- [ ] Remove the Settings Online pointer once players have had a release or two to relearn the location
- [ ] 1.9.0 release-notes credit sweep: nromey's Unreleased bullets (engine audio arc, physics realism, playlists, place callouts, speed-limit audits, signature v3) carry no "Thanks to" attribution yet -- credit them with the PR link when the 1.9.0 notes are cut, per the contributor-credit rule in AGENTS.md
- [x] The drivers-board progress percent is readable in-game: the R route report leads with "N percent there" (`Trip.progress_percent`, same position/total figure presence posts) and the Tab status menu carries a Progress line; deadhead drives included
- [x] Braille-friendly driving readouts: the on-demand C, R, V, and F reports front-load the answer so the first line of a one-line braille display carries it (displays are 14 to 80 cells, commonly 40, and screen readers flash game speech one line at a time); terse speech additionally trims the C report to time, verdict, and hours of service
- [ ] Braille pass over the remaining spoken surfaces (event announcements, menus, arrival and settlement summaries): same front-loading rule, and check flash-message length against a 40-cell display


## Completed 1.9 release gate work

These checked items retain their recorded status and original investigation
notes. See [the open release checklist](../ROADMAP.md#release-cutover-checklist)
for remaining work. Their completion has not been revalidated by this
documentation edit.

- [x] Mechanical blinker recording for automatic steering-position ticks and
      full-assist lane-change signals, waiting for playback to finish before
      repeating, retaining the I-key locator and center confirmation.

- [x] Engine lane-position panning for partial/off lane keeping; full centers
      the engine, with the existing lane locator unchanged.

- [x] **Portable Windows runtime (2026-09-06).** Include the official x64
      Visual C++ redistributable DLLs beside the game, and refuse to package
      missing runtime dependencies in the game or its bundled libraries.

- [x] **The auto-updater can actually finish AND install an update
      (2026-08-31).** Testers reported an endless update loop on the first
      real tester snapshot; driving the real updater over the MCP agent
      server found TWO independent causes, either one enough for the loop.
      One: the net layer's GitHub client carries a 15-second global
      deadline (Python's socket timeout, mis-ported as a total one), so
      the 294 MB asset died mid-transfer every time ("timeout: global";
      and `timeout_recv_response` alone re-broke it at 25 percent -- ureq
      charges body reads against that phase too). Downloads now stream off
      a dedicated client with a connect timeout only; Escape still
      cancels. Two: `fs::canonicalize` hands the apply script a Windows
      verbatim path (`\\?\C:\...`), which robocopy refuses outright -- the
      captured script proved both copies failed silently and the OLD build
      relaunched. The verbatim prefix is stripped before the script is
      written. Testers must hand-download the first fixed build: the
      broken updater cannot deliver its own fix.

- [x] **Every staged release payload is scanned for secret-shaped content
      (2026-08-30).** Prompted by a one-click decompile of a shipped
      build: the code and assets are public or lift-able by design, so
      the only absolute is that no credential ever ships. The payload
      verifier now fails the build on secret-shaped file names (`.env*`,
      `*.pem`, deploy keys) or content matching known token formats
      (Convex deploy keys, Vercel blob tokens, GitHub tokens, private
      key blocks, JWTs, AWS/Slack/OpenAI shapes). Binaries and media are
      not scanned -- text credentials never belong there and false
      positives would train everyone to ignore the gate.

- [x] Quit-to-menu while MOVING executes before its own warning finishes
      speaking -- FIXED 2026-08-30: a moving truck now gets a
      confirmation first ("You will lose 67 miles since your last stop.
      Quit anyway?", Keep driving is the first row); parked quits stay
      instant. (Owner lost 67 miles on I-80, 2026-07-27.)

- [x] Boot does not accept input until the device probes finish --
      FIXED 2026-08-30 in two halves: the speech probe moved onto the
      speech worker (a25d4236), and the audio device probe now runs on
      its own worker thread while the game boots on the null backend;
      the real backend swaps in when the probe lands, replaying the
      menu music, volumes and voice setting. A device that never opens
      arms the "no sound on this computer" notice, spoken at the menu
      even when it lands after the greeting.

- [x] No on-demand career backup (Brandon lost the upload control) --
      FIXED 2026-09-01: "Back up this career now" on each career's Cloud
      backup screen.

- [x] Adaptive cruise's limit lookahead ignores time compression -- FIXED
      2026-09-01: the lookahead now covers the road the truck passes while
      the setpoint walks down in real seconds, capped at the spoken
      warning's own five miles.

- [x] Speed keeper announces a number it then fails to hold (live
      tester thread) -- FIXED 2026-09-01, from Brandon's log: "set 40",
      "holding 20 for the corner" from the top of the on-ramp to the end
      of a 350-foot acceleration lane, merged at 19 into 40 mph traffic.
      The keeper's memory of the corner it was slowing for is a milepost
      on the STREET trip, and it survived `replace_trip` into the highway
      trip, whose mileposts start again from zero. Cleared on the swap,
      with the corner latches.

- [x] A cell of the live-weather lookup that straddles a state line
      sampled the truck's live position, so the station key moved a few
      hundred yards at a time and each move was a fresh NWS fetch: 29 in
      one minute crossing into Louisiana on I-20 (Brandon's log,
      2026-09-01). FIXED 2026-09-01: the sample is the first quarter mile
      of the cell inside the truck's state. The `real_weather` log line
      per fetch stays, so a repeat of this shape is visible in any log.
