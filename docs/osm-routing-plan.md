# OSM Routing, Region, And Map-Expansion Plan

This is the design plan for redesigning Freight Fate's routing, trip, and
job-generation data around OpenStreetMap, fixing region classification errors
(for example, Reno was tagged as the Rockies), and growing the map toward
full-US coverage without breaking the offline-first, deterministic,
accessibility-first design.

It builds on the existing data contract in
[`docs/route-stop-data.md`](route-stop-data.md) and the freight model in
[`docs/freight-market-facilities.md`](freight-market-facilities.md). Read those
first; this plan extends them, it does not replace them.

## Decisions Driving This Plan

These were chosen deliberately and shape everything below:

1. **Runtime posture: offline-first plus an optional online tier.** The bundled
   static data remains the source of truth and the game stays fully playable
   with no network. When a connection is available, an optional background tier
   may refresh and extend data, modeled exactly on the existing Open-Meteo
   weather provider: cached, non-blocking, graceful `None` fallback, never on
   the hot game loop.
2. **Map scope: bundle a moderate curated network, stream finer detail.** Ship a
   substantially larger curated network as static data. When online, pull
   additional corridors and POIs for the player's area into a local overlay
   cache that persists for later offline play (progressive enrichment).
3. **Routing engine: OpenRouteService (HGV/heavy-goods profile).** Truck-aware
   routing (legal truck roads, grade/steepness, tollways, height/weight context)
   instead of the current car-only OSRM. Free hosted tier for development, with
   Docker self-hosting available for heavy batches.
4. **Regions: finer set, derived from coordinates.** Replace hand-typed region
   strings with a build-time classifier that assigns each city a region by
   point-in-polygon against authoritative boundaries, using an honest, finer
   taxonomy (for example Great Basin and Sierra rather than forcing Reno into
   the Rockies).

## Why This Fits The Existing Architecture

- Runtime driving already never calls OSM/OSRM/Overpass; those are build-time
  inputs. Open-Meteo is the only runtime network call and is the template for
  the optional online tier.
- The network is a curated intercity graph (currently 59 city nodes, 106 legs in
  [`world.json`](../src/freight_fate/data/world.json)), not "every US road."
  "Whole US" here means a much larger curated node/leg network plus harvested
  POIs, still baked to static data. Shipping a live routing engine is not
  realistic: the US OSM extract is about 11 GB and building a routing graph
  needs hundreds of GB of scratch space.
- New dispatchable freight is already gated behind a strict metadata-complete
  contract (`World.leg_metadata_complete`); the job board must not invent route
  conditions. Every expansion below must keep that gate green.

## Non-Goals

- No live routing engine shipped to end users.
- No per-frame or mid-trip network calls. Once a trip is dispatched, its route,
  grades, stops, tolls, state lines, and weigh stations are fixed (the
  determinism contract in `docs/route-stop-data.md`).
- No raw OSM IDs, tags, or source keys exposed in speech, menus, or help text.

### Ramp advisory-speed contract

The first roadside-advisory slice is deliberately limited to exit ramps.
During an OSM harvest, `maxspeed:advisory:forward` or
`maxspeed:advisory:backward` wins for travel in that OSM way direction, with
undirected `maxspeed:advisory` as the fallback. OSM's maxspeed syntax makes a
bare number kilometres per hour; `km/h`, `kmh`, `kph`, and explicit `mph` are
normalized to mph. Conditional, symbolic, multiple, implausible, or malformed
values are rejected rather than guessed. The harvester resolves OSM way
direction into the leg's A-to-B/B-to-A direction before storing it.

An accepted value is stored with a read citation to OpenStreetMap. If the
ramp has no trustworthy tag, the runtime retains the existing explicit
`Calculated` result from corridor speed and connector class. That fallback is
not sign evidence and must never acquire an OSM/read source or be described as
an observed sign. Ordinary-road advisory tags remain the curve layer's job.

An ordinary advisory sign is not a truck-specific safe-speed guarantee. FMCSA
warns that exit/ramp advisory speeds are generally set for passenger vehicles
and that a large truck's safe speed is usually lower. Freight Fate therefore
uses an observed value only as a cap: the operating target is the lower of the
read sign and the existing calculated ramp target. A high OSM value can never
make the truck or its assists take a ramp faster. Truck-rollover advisory signs
need their own explicit source signal and are not inferred from a generic
`maxspeed:advisory` tag. Sources consulted 2026-08-26:
https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/safety/driver-safety/cmv-driving-tips-too-fast-conditions
and MUTCD 11th Edition section 2C.12,
https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/pdfs/11th_Edition/Chapter2c.pdf.

OpenStreetMap documents `maxspeed:advisory` as a recommended, non-legally
binding speed and documents the `:forward`/`:backward` suffixes relative to
way direction. OSM data is ODbL 1.0 and requires OpenStreetMap contributor
credit; Freight Fate stores normalized facts and citations, not copied map
geometry, under the project's existing OSM attribution practice. Sources
consulted 2026-08-26: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:maxspeed:advisory,
https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:maxspeed, and
https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright.

The production ingestion path is `tools/build_interchanges.py --ramp-controls`:
the local-PBF topology pass reads advisory tags and OSM node order from
`motorway_link` ways, resolves actual travel order (including `oneway=-1`),
matches each directed gore to the nearest interchange and the leg geometry's
A-to-B heading, then writes `ramp_advisory_forward`,
`ramp_advisory_backward`, and `ramp_advisory_source` through `save_world`.
The 2026-08-26 national local-PBF sweep matched trusted readings to **6,539
interchanges** in the checked-in world. It stored 10,693 directional values
because many physical interchanges have readings in both directions. Values
range from 5 to 80 mph; metric signs retain their normalized mph equivalent.
The deterministic harvester-boundary fixture exercises the same production
transform without depending on the dated national extracts.

The same pass bakes `ramp_length_ft_forward`, `ramp_length_ft_backward` and
`ramp_length_source` (derived): the distance along the `motorway_link` ways
from the gore node, where the ramp way leaves the motorway way, to the nearest
surface-road node or dead end, or else to the merge onto another motorway. The
length starts at or near the gore, so the deceleration lane in front of it is
not included. Values under 300 ft or over 1.5 mi are dropped, not clamped. On
2026-09-24 the pass gave 16,882 of 18,165 exits (92.9%) a length in at least
one direction, 21,577 directional values in all. The median is 1,474 ft, the
5th percentile 735 ft and the 95th 3,456 ft. The screen dropped 172 short
values and 47 long ones. The counts are in `meta.json` under
`ramp_length_bake`. The topology pass caches each state extract separately, so
a national rebuild (about 35 minutes) can be run a few states at a time.

## Workstream A: Region Taxonomy (Fixes Reno Now)

This is the smallest, highest-value change and is independent of the map
expansion. It can ship first.

### Current state

`region` is a hand-typed string per city in `world.json`. It drives weather
weighting, hazard flavor, fuel pricing, menu labels, and (indirectly) market
tags. Known errors: Reno is `rockies` (it is Great Basin / eastern Sierra,
western Nevada); Boise as `rockies` is also shaky (Snake River Plain /
intermountain).

Region is consumed in these places, so each new region value needs entries in
all of them:

- `REGION_WEIGHTS` / weather sampling — [`sim/weather.py`](../src/freight_fate/sim/weather.py)
- `REGION_HAZARDS` — [`sim/trip.py:39`](../src/freight_fate/sim/trip.py)
- `REGION_FUEL_PRICE` — [`models/economy.py`](../src/freight_fate/models/economy.py)
- `REGION_MARKET_TAGS` — [`data/world.py:447`](../src/freight_fate/data/world.py)
- `REGION_LABELS` (spoken/displayed names) — [`states/main_menu.py:485`](../src/freight_fate/states/main_menu.py)

### Locked region taxonomy (14)

Anchored on NOAA climate regions (for weather) crossed with USGS physiographic
provinces (for grades/hazards), then sanity-checked for freight character. Each
region below lists its identity and starting flavor-table values. Fuel prices
are starting points to balance, in dollars per gallon, replacing the current
eight-region `REGION_FUEL_PRICE`. Hazards are written in the style of the
existing `REGION_HAZARDS`. Boundary cases noted in the assignments are the only
judgment calls; everything else is unambiguous.

**Eastern / Appalachian**

- `northeast` — humid continental, nor'easters and snow, dense corridor
  traffic, coastal-plain-to-rolling terrain. Weather lean: snow, rain, cloud,
  fog up; thunderstorm low. Fuel ~4.15. Hazards: sudden lane closure; stopped
  traffic around a fender bender. Markets: port, intermodal, industrial, retail.
- `appalachia` — Appalachian/Allegheny mountains, sustained grades, valley fog,
  winter ice. Weather lean: fog and snow up, rain up. Fuel ~3.95. Terrain
  leans hills/mountain. Hazards: runaway-truck ramp warning on the steep grade;
  fog settling in the hollow ahead. Markets: industrial, mining, manufacturing.
- `great_lakes` — cold snowy winters, lake-effect snow, summer thunderstorms,
  flat industrial Midwest. Weather lean: snow (lake-effect) and thunderstorm
  and wind up. Fuel ~3.75. Hazards: lake-effect snow squall whiting out the
  lane; a deer crossing the road. Markets: intermodal, manufacturing,
  automotive, agriculture.

**Central**

- `heartland` — corn belt plus Missouri/Mississippi valley, thunderstorms,
  moderate snow. Weather lean: thunderstorm and wind up. Fuel ~3.60. Hazards:

  hurricanes. Weather lean: thunderstorm up, clear up, heavy rain moderate,
  snow near zero. Fuel ~3.65. Hazards: stopped traffic around a fender bender;
  a sudden thunderstorm downpour. Markets: port, manufacturing, retail, food.
- `gulf_coast` — Gulf humid subtropical, heavy rain, hurricanes, heat. Weather
  lean: thunderstorm and heavy rain up strongly, fog up, snow near zero. Fuel
  ~3.40 (refining belt, cheapest). Hazards: standing water flooding the lane; a
  fog bank rolling across the lanes. Markets: port, energy, chemical, food.
- `florida` — peninsular subtropical to tropical, daily storms, hurricanes,
  flat. Weather lean: thunderstorm up very strongly, heavy rain up, snow zero.
  Fuel ~3.85. Hazards: a sudden thunderstorm downpour; stopped traffic around a
  fender bender. Markets: port, food, retail, cold_chain.

**Western**

- `rockies` — Rocky Mountains plus Front Range, heavy snow, altitude grades,
  wind. Weather lean: snow up strongly, wind up, clear up. Fuel ~3.95. Terrain
  leans mountain. Hazards: rockfall debris on the road; a runaway truck on the
  grade ahead. Markets: mining, intermodal, construction.
- `great_basin` — Basin and Range plus Snake River Plain plus eastern Sierra,
  arid, big temperature swings, mountain passes. Weather lean: clear up
  strongly, wind up, snow up at passes, fog low. Fuel ~4.10 (remote). Hazards:
  a crosswind gust shoving the trailer; snow drifting across the mountain pass.
  Markets: intermodal, mining, retail. **This is the Reno fix.**
- `desert_southwest` — Sonoran/Mojave/Chihuahuan deserts plus Colorado Plateau,
  extreme heat, dust storms, monsoon, border freight. Weather lean: clear up
  very strongly, wind (dust) up, monsoon thunderstorm moderate, snow near zero.
  Fuel ~4.00. Hazards: a dust devil crossing the interstate; tumbleweeds piling
  in your lane. Markets: border, construction, food, mining.

  Sierra grades, highest fuel. Weather lean: clear up, fog up strongly
  (marine plus valley tule), cloud up, snow low. Fuel ~5.10 (CARB, highest).
  Hazards: a fog bank rolling across the lanes; a stalled car jutting off the
  shoulder. Markets: port, food, retail, intermodal.
- `pacific_northwest` — marine west coast, persistent rain, Cascade grades and
  snow. Weather lean: rain and cloud up very strongly, fog up, snow moderate
  inland/Cascade. Fuel ~4.45. Hazards: an elk crossing the road; standing water
  in your lane. Markets: port, lumber, agriculture, intermodal.

### City assignments (all 59)

- `northeast`: New York, Boston, Hartford, Philadelphia, Baltimore
- `appalachia`: Pittsburgh, Knoxville
- `great_lakes`: Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati,
  Indianapolis, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Buffalo (Buffalo placed here for
  lake-effect, not `northeast`)
- `heartland`: St. Louis, Kansas City, Des Moines, Omaha (St. Louis borderline
  vs `great_lakes`)
- `southern_plains`: Dallas, Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Wichita, Amarillo
- `mid_south`: Nashville, Memphis, Louisville, Little Rock, Birmingham
  (Louisville borderline vs `great_lakes`)
- `atlantic_southeast`: Charlotte, Raleigh, Richmond, Atlanta, Savannah
- `gulf_coast`: Houston, New Orleans, San Antonio (San Antonio borderline vs
  `southern_plains`)
- `florida`: Jacksonville, Tampa, Miami (Jacksonville borderline vs
  `atlantic_southeast`)
- `rockies`: Denver, Cheyenne, Salt Lake City (SLC is the Wasatch Front, edge
  of `rockies`/`great_basin`)
- `great_basin`: Reno, Boise
- `desert_southwest`: Phoenix, Tucson, Las Vegas, Albuquerque, El Paso
- `california`: Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Sacramento, Fresno
- `pacific_northwest`: Seattle, Portland, Spokane (Spokane is inland semi-arid,
  drier and colder than the coast)

These assignments are the expected output of the build-time classifier; the
stored-equals-derived test enforces them. The classifier polygons must be drawn
so each city above falls in its listed region (in particular the Wasatch Front,
eastern Sierra, and Snake River Plain boundaries that separate `rockies`,
`great_basin`, `california`, and `pacific_northwest`).

### Implementation

1. Add region boundary polygons as a checked-in build asset (GeoJSON), sourced
   from authoritative public boundaries (Census regions/divisions as a base,
   refined with physiographic boundaries for Great Basin / Sierra). Attribution
   recorded in source notes.
2. Add a build-time classifier (new helper in `tools/`, or extend
   `enrich_routes.py`) that does point-in-polygon on each city's lat/lon and
   writes the resulting `region` into `world.json`. Region stays a checked-in
   string field, so runtime code is unchanged except for new region values.
3. Populate the five region tables above for every new region value.
4. Add a test asserting each city's stored `region` equals the classifier's
   output for its coordinates. This catches both bad coordinates and future
   drift as the map grows, so a Reno-style error cannot recur.

### Accessibility note

**Done.** The new-career picker is now two spoken levels: a region list
(`HomeTerminalState`) whose entries name each region and its city count, then a
per-region city list (`HomeCityState`). Both keep the standard menu model
(arrows, Home/End, Enter, Escape, F1, first-letter jump); region menu names drop
the leading "the" so type-ahead works. This keeps spoken navigation manageable
as the map grows toward national coverage instead of one long flat city list.
Escape steps back city list -> region list -> name entry. The default flow still
lands on the default city's region and then the default city.

## Workstream B: OpenRouteService HGV Build Pipeline

Replace/augment the car-only OSRM build step with truck-aware OpenRouteService.

### What ORS gives us that OSRM does not

- HGV (heavy-goods) profile: routes on legal truck roads.
- Elevation along the route (`elevation=true`), reducing or replacing the
  separate Open-Meteo elevation sampling step.
- `extras`: steepness (maps to our `grade_segments`/terrain), tollways (seeds
  `toll_events` candidates), waytype, surface.
- Optional vehicle parameters (height, weight, length, axle load, hazmat) for
  future cargo-aware routing.

### Implementation

**Scaffold done** (ready for a key): `tools/enrich_routes.py` uses the official
`openrouteservice` Python SDK (a build-time-only `tooling` dependency group, so
the shipped game stays dependency-light; the runtime online tier will stay on
stdlib `urllib` like the Open-Meteo provider). It has the driving-hgv client
(`fetch_ors_hgv_route`, lazy-imports the SDK), the pure response mapper
(`parse_ors_route` -> miles, 2D coordinates, per-vertex elevation in feet,
steepness, tollway flag), the request-kwargs builder (`_ors_directions_kwargs`),
the `ORS_API_KEY` env helper (`ors_api_key`), and a credential-gated
`--ors-smoke` CLI that runs one real corridor request and prints distance,
points, elevation range, steepness segments, and tollway yes/no. The mapping is
unit-tested without network or the SDK in `tests/test_ors_pipeline.py`
(including that ORS elevation feeds the existing `_grade_segments`). Default
behavior is unchanged; OSRM is still the active engine until the key lands.

**Live and wired** (key set, validated against `api.heigit.org`):

1. Key set in `ORS_API_KEY`; base URL points at HeiGIT
   (`ORS_DEFAULT_BASE_URL`, override `ORS_BASE_URL`). Validate with
   `uv run --group tooling python tools/enrich_routes.py --from-city Chicago
   --to-city Indianapolis --ors-smoke`.
2. `enrich_all_routes` has an `--engine {osrm,ors}` switch. With `ors`, corridor
   `route_points`, `elevation_samples` (from ORS inline 3D geometry, no separate
   Open-Meteo call), and `grade_segments` come from the driving-hgv route;
   `state_crossings`/`state_miles` stay on the Census step; ORS responses cache
   in `.route-cache/ors`. OSRM remains the default. `--ors-compare` gives a
   read-only ORS-vs-checked-in sanity check.

Findings from the first comparisons, to handle before/within a `--write` batch:

- **Tollways:** ORS flags tolled segments the curated data may not model yet
  (e.g. a toll near Chicago on Chicago-Indianapolis). The tollway flag only says
  *a leg has tolls*; compliant `toll_events` still need a named authority,
  amount, method, and source, so toll curation stays manual — treat the flag as
  a "needs toll review" signal.
- **Mileage shifts:** the ORS truck route can differ from curated miles (e.g.
  Denver-Salt Lake City ~490 vs 520). A `--write` batch would change leg miles,
  which feed pay and deadlines, so regeneration of existing legs is a deliberate
  step, not automatic. New expansion legs take ORS miles as authoritative.
- **Grade detail (done):** ORS legs now sample denser (~1 point per 30 mi) and
  build multiple terrain-grouped grade segments (`grade_segments_from_samples`)
  instead of one averaged segment, so up/down structure survives (Denver-Salt
  Lake City went from one ~0% segment to seven). The gate stays lenient so
  legacy OSRM legs (single averaged segment) still pass. Finer mountain
  detection from the ORS `steepness` extra (OSM-way resolution, vs ~30 mi
  sampling) remains a future refinement. ORS `tollway_detected` is stored and
  the coverage report surfaces a non-blocking `toll_review` advisory for tolled
  legs lacking curated `toll_events` (e.g. Cleveland-Toledo, Ohio Turnpike).

Operational notes: rate limits are per-endpoint on the free tier (directions a
few thousand/day); the resumable batch + `.route-cache` handle polite staging,
and Docker self-hosting (regional/national OSM extract plus RAM) is the unlimited
path for large batches. OSRM stays as a graceful fallback.

### Local service/facility approaches

The city-service local-geometry layer is deliberately separate from the ORS HGV
highway-corridor layer. `tools/build_local_geometry.py` uses local Geofabrik PBF
extracts to build a small public-road graph around each supported city-service
target and writes `local_geometry.json` for offline runtime use. The first bake
adds turn-level geometry for 412 sourced city-service drives and fallback
metadata for the rest of the 2,401 local targets.

The freight facility endpoint layer is separate again. `tools/build_facility_endpoints.py`
scans the same local PBF cache at `C:\Users\joshu\.cache\freight-fate-osm\regions\`
and writes `facility_endpoints.json`: 1,462 of 1,819 facilities now have
source-backed OSM freight/industrial endpoint matches, and 357 remain explicit
representative fallbacks. This layer does not snap endpoints to roads and does
not claim gates, yards, docks, driveways, or HGV-legal turn-by-turn routing.

`tools/build_facility_approaches.py` is the next bounded layer. It reuses those
source-backed endpoints plus `local_approaches.json`, then scans only selected
local PBFs for high-confidence public-road paths. The current checked-in bake
uses Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio from the local cache and writes
`facility_approaches.json`: 71 source-backed facility endpoints now have
road-snapped public-road context, and 6 are long enough to use as playable
turn-level public-road approach geometry. The remaining facilities stay
explicit fallback records. This still is not ORS `driving-hgv`, and it does
not prove private gates, yards, docks, driveways, or truck-legal access.

This local graph output is not ORS `driving-hgv` and should not be described as
truck-legal routing. ORS HGV remains feasible for selected sourced service
endpoints when `ORS_API_KEY` is available, but using it for the full local batch
would be hundreds of live directions calls and would still not make
representative freight-facility endpoints into real gates, yards, or docks.
Future work can add a credential-gated ORS local batch or a self-hosted HGV
router, then compare it against the current PBF graph output before replacing
any checked-in local geometry.

### Other ORS/HeiGIT APIs (optional, for later workstreams)

Beyond directions, the ORS suite has endpoints worth using as the map grows
(each has its own free-tier daily quota):

- **Matrix** — many-to-many time/distance; efficient for choosing new-node
  adjacencies in Workstream C without N separate directions calls.
- **POIs (places)** — category POI search (fuel, parking, etc.) within a
  bbox/polygon/around a route; an alternative source to the existing Overpass
  tooling, on the same OSM data, still requiring curation of names/actions.
- **Elevation** (point/line) — standalone elevation; mostly redundant now that
  directions returns elevation inline, but useful for non-routed points (facility
  or city elevation).
- **Geocoder (Pelias)** — name/address -> coordinates; handy for placing specific
  named facilities precisely (GeoNames/Census still drive the node list).
- Snapping, isochrones, optimization, matching, export are not needed here.

### Licensing / attribution

ORS and OSM-derived data carry ODbL/attribution obligations. The data contract
already requires this; keep OSM, ORS, and OpenStreetMap attribution visible in
release materials and per-record source notes.

## Workstream C: Tiered Map Expansion

Grow from 59 cities toward national coverage in staged, always-green batches.

### Data sources: which cities, which structures

ORS connects nodes but does not choose them, and the current ORS `waycategory`
extra only flags tollways, fords, ferries, steps, and highways — not bridges or
tunnels. Those gaps are filled by separate sources:

- **New city nodes:** a populated-places dataset supplies name, state,
  coordinates, and population so the next tier of US metros can be picked and
  ranked. Preferred: GeoNames (free, CC BY; the `cities5000`/`cities15000` or
  `US.txt` dumps include population and admin1/state). Alternative: the Census
  Gazetteer "Places" files (Census is already used for state boundaries) joined
  with Census population estimates. Rank candidates by freight importance using
  FAF/BTS (already the market-model guidance), not raw population alone, so the
  map gains freight hubs (a Memphis) rather than just large suburbs. The
  build-time region classifier (`data/regions.py`) then assigns each new node's
  region from its coordinates, and the stored-equals-derived test keeps it
  honest.
- **Bridges, tunnels, and named crossings:** OpenStreetMap via Overpass
  (`bridge=yes`, `tunnel=yes`, named structures), projected onto the checked-in
  route geometry the same way POIs and checkpoints are. Curate notable named
  structures (for example the Eisenhower Tunnel or the Chesapeake Bay Bridge) as
  route checkpoints/events with game-authored spoken cues; tolled crossings
  cross-reference toll-authority data into `toll_events`, and pass/tunnel summit
  context comes from the elevation source. ORS extras are not a reliable source
  for these.

### Bundled tier (static, deterministic)

1. Pick new nodes from GeoNames/Census (above) in stages (for example
   59 -> ~150 -> ~300 cities), plus key interchange nodes so truck routing
   follows realistic corridors rather than long city-to-city straight hops.
   Choose each new node's adjacencies (nearest neighbours along real corridors)
   before routing.
2. Generate legs between adjacent nodes via ORS HGV, then auto-enrich each leg
   to the metadata-complete contract (route points, elevation/grade, state
   context, source-backed POIs at the required density).
3. Keep `tools/enrich_routes.py --coverage-report --json` green after every
   batch. A leg only becomes a normal dispatch lane once it passes the gate; the
   legacy/full graph stays loadable for old saves.
4. Harvest POIs via the existing Overpass and operator-feed tooling
   (`discover_route_pois.py`, `curate_route_pois.py`), and bridges/tunnels via
   Overpass (above), curated into clean player-facing names — no raw OSM text.

### Expansion status (batches)

- **Batch 1 (done):** Toledo, OH and Fort Wayne, IN (great_lakes), four short
  interstate legs (Detroit-Toledo, Cleveland-Toledo, Toledo-Fort Wayne,
  Indianapolis-Fort Wayne). Pipeline used: `pick_nodes` -> add nodes/legs ->
  `enrich_all --engine ors` (geometry/elevation/grades/state) ->
  `curate_route_pois` (one source-backed Love's/Flying J per leg). Coverage
  stayed 110/110 playable.

**Update:** the POI gate has since been removed (dispatch now gates on routing
metadata only; POIs are additive). Batch 1 above predates that change -- it
shows the old POI-curation bottleneck that motivated the gate relaxation. The
current playbook is much lighter:

1. `pick_nodes` to choose interstate-adjacent metros (prune artifacts).
2. Add the city nodes (`locations: []` -> template facilities, classifier-derived
   regions) and their legs to `world.json`.
3. `enrich_all --engine ors --write` -- routing metadata alone makes each leg
   dispatchable (no POI curation required); HOS fallbacks cover stop-less legs.
4. `--adopt-ors-miles --write` so new legs carry real ORS truck distance.
5. Optionally `curate_route_pois --write-world` to raise POI quality where
   operator feeds reach the corridor (purely additive).
6. End green: run the coverage report (legs playable on routing; `poi_review`
   and `toll_review` are advisory) and bump the leg count in
   `tests/test_route_coverage_tool.py`.

Urban metro-twin legs (e.g. Dallas-Fort Worth on I-30) still make poor *POI*
corridors, but they no longer block dispatch, so Fort Worth can be added now if
desired.

### Streamed tier (optional online overlay)

When online, the optional tier fetches additional secondary corridors and POIs
for the player's current area and writes them into a local overlay cache (in the
user data directory, like portable saves), so they are available for later
offline play. The bundled core never changes; the overlay is purely additive.

---

## Workstream D: Optional Online Runtime Tier

Mirror the Open-Meteo provider precisely. This is the only new runtime network
surface, and it is always optional.

### Design rules (determinism and accessibility safety)

- Background thread, cached, non-blocking; returns `None` when offline,
  unavailable, or rate-limited. The loop never waits on it.
- It only acts **between trips** (at the city hub and at job acceptance/
  dispatch). Once a `Trip` is constructed, its route and all route facts are
  fixed for the run. No mid-drive mutation.
- Output is written to a namespaced overlay file, never into the checked-in
  `world.json`. With the overlay absent, behavior is byte-for-byte identical to
  today.

### Components

1. **World overlay loader.** *Done (foundation).* `World.load(path, overlay=...)`
   merges the checked-in base with an optional overlay of extra cities and legs,
   purely additively: the overlay can only add cities/legs the base lacks, never
   override the base, and with no overlay the result is exactly the base world
   (offline/deterministic path unchanged). `get_world` deliberately does not pass
   an overlay yet, so runtime is untouched until the online tier wires it in.
   Still to do when wiring: the user-data overlay path, and preserving stable
   facility IDs / the `route_from_cities` legacy path across overlay loads.
2. **`RealRouteProvider`** (new, sibling to `RealWeatherProvider`): given an
   origin/destination, fetch a fresh HGV route in the background and cache it.
   Used at job-accept/dispatch to optionally upgrade an accepted job's route
   fidelity, and to progressively pull nearby corridors/POIs for the current
   region into the overlay. Offline always falls back to bundled static data.
3. **Settings + accessibility.** A spoken setting to enable/disable online
   enrichment, defaulting to a privacy- and offline-friendly choice. Any new
   data surfaced to the player follows the existing spoken-label conventions.

## Workstream E: Corridor Cues As Signage

With ORS truck miles now authoritative (Workstream B) and OSM POIs mapped across
the network, the remaining corridor data the game speaks while driving is the
navigation/orientation layer. This workstream decides what to do with it.

### What we surface today

Three derived layers, announced as the truck drives (see `Trip.next_navigation_context`):

- **`state_crossings`** -> "crossing from Illinois into Indiana near the I-65
  state line south of Hammond".
- **`checkpoints`** (named places) -> "Next place in N miles: Lafayette" --
  control-city-style orientation.
- **`grade_segments` / `elevation_samples`** -> terrain and grade cues;
  **`state_miles`** -> per-state mileage.

### Decision: keep it, but make it consequential

The cues are the orientation backbone of an audio-first sim, and each maps to
something real drivers track. The value is the **consequence**, not the
narration, so the work is to wire cues to gameplay rather than add more lines:

- **State lines are meaningful** (IFTA fuel-tax jurisdiction, speed-limit and
  chain-law changes, ports-of-entry / weigh stations cluster at borders). Keep
  the crossing as an *event* and hang a consequence on it (speed-limit change,
  weigh-station stop, fuel-price shift).
- **Checkpoints / control cities** are how truckers orient against guide signs.
  Cheap and already derived -- keep.
- **Grades** are the highest-value cue (brake checks, runaway ramps, chain-up
  areas) and already have dense ORS data; extend the existing grade warnings.

### On "use state sign data instead of 'crossing state line'"

Data-reality check, because it constrains the design:

- **Welcome-to-X signs are not reliably in OSM** -- no standard tag, near-zero
  coverage. Announcements cannot be driven off real welcome-sign data.
- **What is available and sign-like:** OSM exit **`destination` /
  `destination:ref`** tags (the control cities printed on green guide signs),
  highway **`ref`** (route shields, well mapped), OSM **`highway=milestone`**
  (mile markers, patchy in the US), and **ORS step instructions** (the directions
  response already returns per-step `instruction` + road `name`/`ref` -- the
  authentic "what the sign says as you approach" source we already pay for).

So the better version of the idea is not synthetic welcome-sign data; it is to
read **ORS steps + OSM `destination`/`ref`** and phrase navigation the way
signage actually reads ("In 2 miles, I-465 toward Indianapolis"), keeping the
state crossing but upgrading its *content* from a generic line to sign-derived
text plus real border context (welcome center / port-of-entry / weigh station
when OSM has one).

### Proposed work items

1. **Sign-derived navigation phrasing.** Extend the ORS pipeline to capture
   step `instruction`/`name`/`ref` and exit `destination` tags into the corridor
   at build time (still offline at runtime, like every other corridor field).
2. **State crossing -> consequence + context.** Attach a speed-limit / weigh
   station / fuel-tax effect to the crossing event and enrich its text with the
   actual border facility when present.
3. **Re-introduce weigh stations as a distinct cue.** They are filtered out of
   the POI stop list (you do not choose to stop there), but a mandatory-stop
   border cue is exactly the kind of consequence above.
4. **Grades -> existing brake/runaway warnings**, driven by the ORS steepness
   extra already stored.
5. **Bridges and tunnels (named crossings).** Add notable spans/tunnels as a cue
   layer, split by cost:

   *Light tier (do first; reuses systems we already have):* curate named bridges
   and tunnels (Eisenhower-Johnson Tunnel, Chesapeake Bay Bridge, the I-95
   Baltimore Harbor / Fort McHenry tunnels) as `RouteCheckpoint`s with authored
   spoken cues; fold tolled crossings into the existing `toll_events`; optionally
   raise a high-profile-vehicle wind advisory on long spans via the weather wind
   system (`audio.set_wind`, the `winter_or_wind` achievement already exist).
   Purely additive and screen-reader-native. Source from OSM Overpass
   (`bridge=yes` / `tunnel=yes` + `name`), projected onto corridor geometry like
   POIs/checkpoints -- ORS `waycategory` does NOT reliably flag bridges/tunnels.

   *Heavy tier (defer; needs new systems):* hazmat and height/clearance
   restrictions (placarded loads are banned in the Holland/Lincoln/Baltimore
   tunnels; over-height loads get turned around). These need a new hazmat cargo
   type / truck-dimension model AND restriction-aware routing (a banned tunnel
   forces an alternate leg), so they are their own workstream, not a bolt-on.
   Good payoff later -- hazmat loads pay more but must detour around tunnels --
   but today endorsements are only refrigerated/heavy_haul/high_value and trucks
   have no modeled height/weight, so the restriction has nothing to bind to yet.

### Constraints

- **Build-time, not runtime.** All of the above is derived into `world.json`
  during the ORS build, so the offline/deterministic runtime path is unchanged
  (same rule as the rest of Workstream B/D).
- **Accessibility.** New cues follow the existing spoken-label conventions and
  the "never interrupt the screen reader for driving events" rule.

---

## Risks And Open Questions

- **`world.json` size at scale.** ~580 KB for 59 cities; ~1.5 MB at 137 cities;
  several MB by ~500, all loaded into memory at startup. The real thresholds are
  startup parse time and git churn, not RAM (a few MB is nothing). It gzips ~94%
  (1.48 MB -> 99 KB), so the verbosity compresses away. Decision on the storage
  format:
  - **Keep `world.json` as the git-tracked source of truth.** The whole
    expansion pipeline (pick_nodes -> add -> enrich -> review the diff -> commit
    per batch) depends on a human-readable, diffable, mergeable file. A SQLite
    `.db` as source would be an opaque binary blob: unreviewable diffs,
    unmergeable conflicts, and worse git churn than the JSON line-diffs. Do not
    make SQLite the source.
  - **If/when runtime memory or startup parse bites (~hundreds of cities),
    compile JSON -> SQLite at build/package time** as a generated artifact (never
    committed). Gives indexed, lazy, low-memory loading while authoring stays
    diffable; `sqlite3` is stdlib, so no new runtime dependency.
  - **Cheaper interim wins first:** ship `world.json.gz` (decompress at load,
    ~94% smaller distribution, ~10 lines of stdlib `gzip`) and/or shard by region
    for lazy loading. Decide the trigger during Workstream C.
- **ORS rate limits vs. batch size.** Hundreds of cities means thousands of
  legs. The free tier needs multi-day polite batches; Docker self-hosting is the
  unlimited path but needs the OSM extract and RAM. Confirm which we use for the
  big batches.
- **Region boundaries need sign-off.** The taxonomy and polygon edges affect
  weather, hazards, fuel price, music, and labels. Lock the region list before
  populating the flavor tables.
- **Terminal-picker accessibility at scale.** Resolved for now: the picker is a
  two-level region -> city submenu (see Workstream A accessibility note). As the
  city count per region grows, revisit whether very large regions need a further
  split (for example by state) so no single city list becomes unwieldy.
- **Determinism guarantee.** The overlay and online tier must never make an
  in-progress trip non-reproducible. Tests should assert that, with no overlay
  and no network, the world and a given trip seed are identical to today.

## Suggested Sequencing

1. **Workstream A (regions).** Self-contained, fixes the visible Reno bug,
   ships first.
2. **Workstream B (ORS build pipeline).** Truck-aware data without changing
   runtime; validate against existing corridors before regenerating.
3. **Workstream D scaffolding (overlay loader + provider).** Additive, with the
   offline path provably unchanged.
4. **Workstream C (expansion).** Staged node growth and streamed overlay, kept
   green by the coverage report at each batch.
5. **Workstream E (corridor cues as signage).** After ORS data is authoritative;
   build-time enrichment of navigation text + per-crossing consequences.

## Acceptance Artifacts

- `tools/enrich_routes.py --coverage-report --json` stays green at every batch.
- Region classifier test: stored region equals derived region for every city.
- Offline-determinism test: with no overlay/network, world and seeded trips are
  unchanged.
- Credential-gated ORS HGV build smoke, skipped in CI without a key.
- Attribution present in release materials and source notes (OSM/ODbL, ORS).
- Corridor cues (Workstream E) derived at build time only: offline-determinism
  test still passes with no network, and each state crossing carries a
  consequence, not just narration.
