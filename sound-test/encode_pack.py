"""Encode the keeper renders into the compressed pack format the game loads.

Norm 2026-07-21: the assets must ship as compressed .ogg to go in the pack. The
game's existing assets are OGG VORBIS at 44.1 kHz (measured), and the loader
(pygame/BASS) decodes Vorbis natively -- Opus would need a plugin, so Vorbis is
the safe drop-in. This converts the WAV renders to Vorbis .ogg at 44.1 kHz and
stages them under a mirror of the in-game sounds tree, so a finalized set can be
dropped into assets/sounds-licensed/ (the gitignored overlay).

Cull first, then run: whatever WAVs are present for the round-robin banks
(clunks, shifts) get encoded, so delete the ones the ear rejected before
staging. Engine mid/high bands still need steady loops cut from the 60624 high-
rpm interior take (1440-2175 rpm) -- listed as PENDING below, not yet encoded.

Outputs to C:\\temp\\ffsound\\pack mirroring the asset keys, with a size report.

Usage: uv run --with numpy --with soundfile --with scipy python sound-test/encode_pack.py
