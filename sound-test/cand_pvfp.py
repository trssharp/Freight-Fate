"""Candidate PVFP -- formant-preserving phase vocoder.

Method: take a seamless INTERIOR idle loop (real driver's-seat stock, so its
fullness and body already match the reference). To reach a target rpm, move the
firing RATE by resampling in time (a time-varying resample gives a continuous
glide), then re-impose the idle's FIXED spectral envelope frame-by-frame in the
STFT domain (cepstral-smoothed original_env / shifted_env). The harmonics move
with rpm; the ~800 Hz cab/block body does NOT -- no micro-engine drift.

Idle   = the real interior loop, tiled (no shift; formants and fullness native).
Rev    = one continuous 7 s pull, idle rpm -> ~1800, formant-locked throughout.
Cruise = the idle loop shifted to a steady 1500 rpm, re-looped seamless.
