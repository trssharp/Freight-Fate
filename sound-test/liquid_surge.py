"""Production bake: the liquid-surge cue layer for tank trailers.

Three assets, all synthesized, all deterministic:

    vehicle/liquid_wash.wav        looping bed: liquid on the move. The game
                                   holds it only while the slug is running and
                                   scales its gain by how fast it is running.
    vehicle/liquid_hit.wav         one-shot: the wave arriving at the head.
    vehicle/liquid_hit_lateral.wav one-shot: the wave arriving at the side --
                                   the rollover case, so a different voice.

Two constraints shaped the spectrum. The jake brake runs on its own channel at
full gain during exactly the deceleration that produces surge, and neither
audio backend has per-loop EQ to carve a hole in it. And the engine and road
beds own everything below about a kilohertz. So this layer does not sonify the
*mass* of the liquid, which would sit right underneath both -- it sonifies the
*surface*: the wash and the slap, banded into 1.5-4 kHz where the only other
occupant is the FM fringe hiss, and that only with the radio on.

The wash is filtered noise with a slow amplitude undulation, so it reads as
moving water rather than as a tone -- there is a standing rule against new
steering tones and this is deliberately not one. The hit is a short broadband
slap through the tank shell's modal ring: brief, unmistakable, and loud enough
to survive a mono speaker at a low effects volume, because it is the event the
whole layer exists to deliver. The lateral hit is the same slap through a
tighter, higher ring so the two are never confused; side-to-side surge is the
one that rolls trucks over, and it also gets speech.

Mono on purpose -- surge is never panned, because the left/right axis already
carries lane guidance and the drift side. 48 kHz, WAV, because LOOPING BEDS
ARE NEVER VORBIS: Vorbis has no overlap partner across the loop wrap and puts
a click back into the seam.

Usage: uv run python sound-test/liquid_surge.py  (writes straight to assets)
