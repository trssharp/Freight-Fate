"""Survey the downloaded Splice truck recordings: what they are, where the usable bits are.

Read-only. Writes a report plus short excerpt WAVs to C:\\temp\\fftest.

Answers the questions that decide how each file gets used:

  1. INTERIOR OR EXTERIOR? Decided on spectral balance, not on the filename.
     An in-cab recording is low-dominated because the firewall and glass
     roll off the top; an exterior take keeps its high end. This matters
     more than anything else -- the game's whole POV is the driver's seat.
  2. REAL OR LOOPED? Cycle-to-cycle correlation, swept over f0. A real take
     sits near 0.67; a tiled loop approaches 1.0. This is the check that
     caught the Hollywood Edge donor, and it has to run on everything now.
  3. WHERE IS THE ENGINE, IN RPM, OVER TIME? A track of firing frequency
     across the file locates the startup ramp, the shifts, the cruise
     sections and the coast-downs without anyone scrubbing a timeline.
  4. WHERE ARE THE QUIET-ENGINE WINDOWS? Moments where road speed stays up
     while the engine unloads -- between shifts, or coasting. Those are the
     wind-and-tire bed, harvested from the right cab.

    HARMONIC SUM, not raw autocorrelation. Plain autocorrelation on an engine

    revving to 3400 rpm, which does not happen. Scoring each candidate f0 by
    the energy at f0, 2f0, 3f0 ... instead means a true fundamental beats its
    own harmonic, because only the true one lines every partial up.

    this engine, so allowing it only invites errors.
