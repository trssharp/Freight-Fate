"""Find and cut the gear-shift transients out of the Sony 18-wheeler interior.

Read-only over the library. Writes candidate one-shots to C:\\temp\\fftest.

WHY. `docs/sound-shortlist.md` need 4 (driveline clunk) was the one the sweep
called thin: "expect to build the shift layer by combining the GMC 6000 clunk,
a pitched-down BustedFX transmission clunk, and a Platinum Sounds air
release." Norm heard an actual shifter being worked in
`Sony/Volume 5/.../18 Wheeler In Idle Stop.flac` -- which is a real
tractor's real shifter, in the cab, against that tractor's own idle. One
genuine event beats three unrelated recordings glued together, and it comes
with the correct room and the correct engine already behind it.

DETECTION. A shift clunk is a short broadband mechanical transient sitting on
a steady idle bed. So: high-pass away the idle fundamental and its low
harmonics, take an energy envelope, and look for sharp rises against the local
median. Using the local median rather than a global threshold matters because
the idle level drifts through the take, and a fixed threshold either misses
quiet shifts or fires constantly on the loud stretch.

Each hit is exported with pre-roll and a tail, so the natural decay is intact
and the cut can be tightened by ear afterwards. Nothing here is a final asset
-- these are candidates to audition against the shipped `vehicle/gear_shift.ogg`.

Usage: uv run --with numpy --with soundfile python sound-test/shifter_extract.py
