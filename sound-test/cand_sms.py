"""Candidate: HARMONIC+NOISE (SMS) engine voice.

Analyse a steady INTERIOR idle window. Estimate the firing-harmonic partial
amplitudes (peaks at multiples of rpm/20) and a residual NOISE floor (the
between-partial spectrum). Resynthesise for any rpm as a sinusoid bank at
rate-scaled harmonic frequencies whose amplitudes are READ FROM A FIXED
SPECTRAL ENVELOPE at each partial's ABSOLUTE frequency -- so the ~800 Hz body
formant never moves with rpm -- plus a filtered noise residual whose level
rises gently with rpm/load.

Seamless idle/cruise loops come from choosing an integer-sample firing period:
with period P samples and a loop of N periods (N*P samples), every harmonic k
completes exactly k*N whole cycles, so the wrap is a true adjacency. The noise
bed is looped by crossfade (make_seamless_loop). Formants are fixed: the
envelope is a function of absolute Hz, evaluated at the moved partial freqs.
