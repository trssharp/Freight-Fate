"""TD-PSOLA engine voice from ONE interior idle take (int_idle_low, 645-1275 rpm).

Method: find the firing rate with C.rpm_track, place pitch marks one firing
period apart (period = 20/rpm s ~ 31 ms at idle), cut 2-period Hann grains at
each mark, then OLA the grains at a NEW target firing period to move rpm while
each grain's internal spectrum -- the fixed cab/block formant -- is left alone.

  idle  -> re-space a steady idle window at the idle period, integer grain count,
           seamless loop.
  rev   -> ramp the target period from idle (~650) up to 1800 rpm over ~7 s.
  cruise-> re-space to 1500 rpm and seamless-loop.

Because every grain is a real idle firing, the ~800 Hz body resonance never
moves with rpm: only the spacing between firings changes. That is the whole
point -- it defeats the micro-engine bug by construction.
