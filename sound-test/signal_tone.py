"""Production bake: the turn-signal indicator tone (`vehicle/signal_tone.wav`).

The owner's call (2026-07-27): the soft relay click that marks lane changes
and blinker cadence is hard to hear for some players; modern cabs play a
DESIGNED indicator tone through the speakers, so a clear tone is the
realistic sound of a current-year tractor -- the bare relay click is the
vintage sound (a future era-equipment option).

One neutral tick-tone, repeated by the game at the blinker cadence and
panned to the signaling side. Short and rounded: it has to read through
engine and road noise without ever being an alarm.

Usage: uv run python sound-test/signal_tone.py  (writes straight to assets)
