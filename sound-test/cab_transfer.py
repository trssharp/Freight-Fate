"""Cab transfer function audition: does a cabin filter "internalize" the engine?

Tester complaint (via Josh, 2026-08-13): the rebuilt engine voice reads as
EXTERNAL -- a truck heard from outside, not from the driver's seat. That is
literally a description of a missing cabin transfer function. The 896 cuts
were recorded in a working cab, but cleanly; a driver's ear gets the engine
through the firewall and glass (strong high-frequency loss), through the
body structure (low-end boom the panels pass and amplify), and inside a
small hard cavity (very short early reflections). None of that is in the
shipped cuts, so the voice sits "in front of" the listener instead of
around them.

This script applies a candidate cab transfer to each licensed engine band
cut and writes loudness-matched A/B/C renders for the owner's ear:

  <band>_1_original.wav       the shipped cut, untouched
  <band>_2_cab.wav            moderate cab: shelf -10 dB above 1 kHz,
                              lowpass at 3.5 kHz, +3 dB body low end,
                              a whisper of 2-4 ms early reflections
  <band>_3_cab_sealed.wav     windows-up cab: -16 dB shelf, 2.4 kHz
                              lowpass, +5 dB body, fuller reflections

Every render is RMS-matched to its original so the A/B judges timbre, not
level (a quieter copy always reads duller). Filters run circularly -- the
IIR warms up over one full loop pass and the reflections wrap -- so each
render still loops seamlessly and can be auditioned on repeat.

If an intensity between _2 and _3 wins, the keeper becomes a real-time
biquad chain on the engine bus (cheap: four biquads + two taps per band),
sitting BETWEEN the engine voice and the ear -- it wraps rebuilt and
classic alike, and the door/window states of the queued cabin-audio work
modulate it later.

Deterministic: pure arithmetic, no randomness. Reads the licensed cuts
(sounds-licensed/engine), writes sound-test/render-cab/*.wav (gitignored).

Usage: uv run python sound-test/cab_transfer.py
