"""Lift the cab/block formants off a real recording and give back the numbers.

Read-only over the library. Writes WAVs and a resonance table to C:\\temp\\fftest.

THE PIANOTEQ MOVE (Norm, 2026-07-20). Modartt measured real instruments to get
a basis, then exposed the parameters so you can twiddle them -- which is why
you can build instruments that never existed. Same shape here: measure a real
in-cab diesel to get the resonance basis, then hand back a table of
frequencies, bandwidths and gains that can be tuned by ear like a piano.

The recording supplies the FILTER. The synth supplies the SOURCE. That split
is the entire point, because it is what a recording cannot give you: a real
loop is welded to one RPM, and pitch-shifting it drags the formants with it,
which is the toy sound. Lift the formants off once and they stop moving, which
is physically correct -- a cab does not resonate differently because the
engine is revving.

METHOD. Linear prediction. LPC fits an all-pole filter to the spectrum, which
is exactly a resonator bank: each conjugate pole pair IS one resonance, with a
centre frequency and a bandwidth. That makes this literally a source/filter
separation rather than an analogy -- the LPC residual is the excitation and
the poles are the structure. Analysis runs at a reduced rate so the available
poles get spent on the region that matters (block, cab, panels, all under a
few kHz) rather than on hiss.

CAVEAT WORTH KNOWING. LPC cannot tell a cab resonance from a strong engine
harmonic. On a very steady recording the firing harmonics are narrow and
loud, and some poles will lock onto them -- which would bake one RPM back
into the "fixed" filter, the exact thing we are trying to avoid. Mitigations
here: pick windows with cycle-to-cycle variation, and report each pole's
bandwidth so narrow ones can be spotted and widened or dropped. A structural
resonance is broad; a captured harmonic is needle-thin.
