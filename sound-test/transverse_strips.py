"""Production bake: dead-man's-curve transverse rumble strips + lane locator.

Two assets for curve navigation:

``vehicle/transverse_strips.wav`` -- the wake-up ahead of a hairpin. Real
DOTs cut transverse rumble strips ACROSS the travel lane before curves
that kill people: grouped bars the whole truck crosses, reading as
duh-duh duh-duh duh-duh -- each burst is the steer axle then the drive
axles over one bar group. Louder and spikier than the shoulder strip on
purpose: less cab filtering, more high frequency kept, because the real
thing is under all six tires at speed and it is MEANT to wake the driver.
Center image (the game plays it unpanned -- the bars span the lane).

``vehicle/lane_locator.wav`` -- a soft on-demand position tock, panned by
the game to where the truck sits in its lane. Quiet and rounded: it is
information the player summoned, never an alarm.

Usage: uv run python sound-test/transverse_strips.py  (writes to assets)

    report: at 1250 it was piercing, and a tone you hold for seconds at a
    time has to be one you can stand). It no longer sits in the bink's
