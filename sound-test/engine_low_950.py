"""Build the engine LOW band (950 rpm) from the 896 mid cut.

The old low band was the 60624 neutral-rev hold, labeled ~1000 rpm -- but its
firing fundamental measures 56.2 Hz = ~1125 rpm, 30 rpm under the mid cut, and
60624 is (probably) a different truck than the 896 donor. Both problems at
once: retire it, and pitch the 896 mid cut (native 1150) down to 950 by
resampling -- a 17% shift, inside the no-chipmunk tolerance, same truck, same
loaded cab timbre. The ring's rate clamps (0.85-1.30) then cover 578-1495 rpm
continuously through the launch zone: 680 reaches 884, 950 spans 807-1235.

Deterministic. Writes C:\\temp\\ffsound\\896\\engine_low_950.wav; re-run
encode_pack.py afterward.

Usage: uv run --with scipy python sound-test/engine_low_950.py
