"""Phase 1 -- a fixed-formant engine VOICE and the in-game MIX around it.

Two things wrong with today's sound, and this addresses both:

  1. The BASS backend plays ONE idle recording and slides its playback
     frequency 1.0x -> 1.75x from 600 to 2200 rpm (audio.py engine_freq_mult).
     Stretching one clip 3x drags every formant up with the pitch, so a big
     diesel turns into a small one as it revs -- Norm's "full engine to micro
     engine". The pygame backend crossfades four loops instead, but three of
     them are thin synthetic loops that sound bad alone.

  2. Nothing is judged in the MIX. In game the engine plays UNDER a road bed
     (vehicle/road at speed/30) and wind, at the category levels engine 0.55,
     road 0.80 (sfx), wind 0.65 (weather). At cruise the road is LOUDER than
     the engine, which is exactly why "in the mix it gets better".

The model here: fixed formants, moving rate. A firing comb (source) is shaped
by the real idle's measured spectral envelope (filter). The rate rides rpm;
the formants never move, so it stays the same size of engine at any rpm. A few
anchor voices across 600-2000 rpm each carry their own timbre (darker at idle,
brighter up top), so the runtime slides each only a little -- "a few formants
to pitch shift", Norm 2026-07-20 -- and the road/wind bed hides the rest.

Reference: C:\\temp\\ffsound\\reference\\idle_647_REAL_interiorized.wav (real
Splice/Blastwave semi idle, transformed into the cab, 647 rpm). Renders go to
C:\\temp\\ffsound\\phase1 -- solos AND in-mix, so the ear judges what the game
actually plays.
