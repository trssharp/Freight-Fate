"""The winning engine voice, re-anchored from ONE coherent truck (Splice 896).

msint won the ear test; this is its cleanup. Instead of anchors stitched from
several takes, every piece is cut from a single real interior recording of a
Mack driving around (SemiTruckMac_S08IN.896) -- so idle, cruise and rev all
share the same engine's character, knock and cab. RPM labels come from the
low-pass tracker (knock removed) and Norm's ear, both verified.

The architecture is simpler than a full multisample because the rev is now a
REAL recorded acceleration, not a crossfade of static anchors:

  idle        steady loop, ~680 rpm
  cruise-mid  steady loop, ~1150 rpm    (a warm hold before the drive)
  cruise-high steady loop, ~1800 rpm    (real highway cruise)
  rev-launch  real acceleration pulling away from a stop (gear-tracking)
  rev-load    real sustained high-rpm pull (lugging at load)

Every clip is loudness-matched so the audition is a fair A/B; the game sets true
levels at runtime. Outputs to C:\\temp\\ffsound\\896.

Usage: uv run --with numpy --with soundfile --with scipy python sound-test/engine_896.py

    A four-stroke cycle is two revolutions -- the period over which the firing

    firing cycle (29 ms at idle) still leaves the slow ~5 Hz lope mismatched at
    the seam, which swells and settles over the first half second of every loop
    (Norm's "weird phase boundary thing"). Find the true cycle period by

    short-crossfade the join -- where the two blended stretches are one whole
