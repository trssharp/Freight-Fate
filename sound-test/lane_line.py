"""Audition prototype: lane-line marker crossing, and a jake loop benchmark.

Audition only -- imports nothing from freight_fate, touches no save data.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The edge-rumble lane change could not reproduce Norm's
remembered "flurpflurp" and the arithmetic says it never will: crossing 3.6 m
in ~3 s is ~1.2 m/s laterally, so a 0.40 m rumble band holds each axle for
~330 ms while the axles are only 90-260 ms apart. They are forced to overlap.

A raised pavement marker is a different object. A wheel crossing the lane
line traverses the marker's ~0.10 m in well under 100 ms, and -- the key
part -- the crossing happens at ONE longitudinal point, so each axle hits AT
MOST ONE marker. Front wheel strikes it, rear wheel strikes the same marker
one wheelbase later. Two bumps. That is the flurp-flurp, and it is a car's
93 ms wheelbase delay that makes it read as a tight pair.

A tractor-trailer turns the same event into a five-hit roll spread over about
half a second, each hit quieter and duller than the last.

Usage: uv run python lane_line.py
