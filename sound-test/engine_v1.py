"""Audition prototype: in-cab diesel cruise loop, synthesized.

Audition only -- imports nothing from freight_fate except reading the shipped
idle loop as a spectral reference. Touches no save data.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The shipped engine/low, mid and high loops are uncredited in
CREDITS.md and measure as synthetic: 52-59% of their energy sits above 4 kHz,
centroid ~7 kHz. A real in-cab diesel is the opposite -- Darren Duff's actual
idle recording (engine/idle.ogg, which IS credited) measures centroid 1109 Hz
with 7% above 4 kHz. So the truck starts as a real diesel and pulls away into
hiss. That is the "not loud enough / not defined" problem: the authority of a
big diesel lives at the firing frequency and its first few harmonics, 50-400
Hz, and there is almost nothing down there in the current loops.

What IS right about them: their firing frequencies measure 50.0 / 75.0 / 105.0
Hz, exactly RPM/20 at 1000 / 1500 / 2100, matching the crossfade centres in
audio.py. The model was correct; the timbre was not.

THE MODEL. Same source/filter architecture as jake_v2.py, because it is the
same engine -- six cylinders on a 720 degree cycle in firing order 1-5-3-6-2-4,
each firing at RPM/120, recombining into the RPM/20 buzz with a half-order
lope. The jake releases compressed air; this burns fuel. Different excitation,
same structure, same fixed resonators. Three layers per cylinder:

  1. Combustion thump -- the torque pulse into the block. Low modes. This is
     the layer that carries authority and the one currently missing.
  2. Diesel knock -- the rapid pressure rise after ignition delay. Broadband,
     1-3 kHz at the source, and it grows with load. This is the "clatter" that
     makes a diesel a diesel rather than a generic engine.
  3. Intake/air rush -- a broadband floor rising with RPM.

Then ONE cab transfer function over the sum. In a conventional the stack is
outside and you are behind a firewall, so what reaches the driver is heavily
low-passed. Getting this filter right is most of the battle; it is exactly
what separates Duff's idle from the synthetic loops.

Turbo whine sits on top, tracking boost rather than firing order, so it is
deliberately NOT harmonically locked to RPM/20.

Every frequency below is a starting guess to be tuned by ear against a real
recording. The STRUCTURE is the claim; the numbers are not.

    This is the fix for "it sounds like the jake" (Norm, 2026-07-20), and it

    IS impulsive -- the exhaust valve cracks near TDC and the pressure dumps,
    so exciting a resonator bank with an impulse is correct for the jake and
    is why the jake is convincing. Combustion is not impulsive. The gas pushes
    the piston through roughly 180 degrees of crank rotation: about 20 ms at
    1500 rpm.

    That duration is what makes an engine sound FULL. With six cylinders
    firing every 6.7 ms and each pushing for ~20 ms, three cylinders are
    under pressure at any instant and the sound never fully decays between
    events. The impulse model decays into silence between firings, and that
    gap is exactly the hollowness Norm heard.

    Note the duration scales with the CYCLE, not with wall-clock time -- at
    2100 rpm the same 180 degrees passes in 14 ms. Fixing it in milliseconds
    would make the engine progressively hollower as it revved.
