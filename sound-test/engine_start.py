"""Diesel startup and shutdown, from the same model as the cruise loops.

Audition only -- imports nothing from freight_fate. Touches no save data.
Writes to C:\\temp\\fftest.

No new synthesis machinery. Startup and shutdown are the cruise engine with a
time-varying RPM and time-varying per-layer gains, which `pulse_train()`
already supports (it takes a per-sample rate array). The interesting content
is entirely in the envelopes.

THE KEY INSIGHT: CRANKING IS THE ENGINE WITH COMBUSTION SWITCHED OFF. The
starter turns the engine over, cylinders compress and pass TDC, but nothing
burns -- so the torque and knock layers are muted and only the block RING
survives. That is the same excitation the jake uses, which makes sense: a
compression release is exactly this minus the release. Three sounds, one
model, distinguished only by which layers are alive.

Startup stages:

  1. Solenoid clack -- the pinion thrown into the flywheel ring gear.
  2. Cranking at 100-200 rpm. Firing rate is RPM/20, so 7.5 Hz at 150 rpm --
     slow enough that you hear individual chuffs rather than a pitch.
  3. UNEVEN cranking. This is what sells it. The starter loads up against
     each compression stroke, so cranking speed surges and drops at the
     compression rate. A steady 150 rpm sounds like a fan; a labouring one
     sounds like a diesel being turned over.
  4. Starter whine. Real numbers here: a truck flywheel ring gear runs
     ~138-150 teeth, so gear mesh sits at `crank_rpm/60 * teeth` -- about
     345 Hz at 150 rpm, climbing as it picks up. A pitched layer, not noise.
  5. Catch. Cylinders come in ONE AT A TIME over a few cycles, not together.
     That brief irregular moment is most of what makes a diesel start sound
     like a diesel start.
  6. Flare and settle. RPM shoots to ~1100, the starter drops out, then it
     drifts back to idle.

Shutdown is startup's mirror with one twist: fuel cuts instantly (torque and
knock to zero within a cycle) while compression continues all the way down,
and the engine stops against a compression stroke it cannot push over --
rocking back slightly. That final stumble is the bit generic shutdown samples
always miss.
