"""Audition: does the synthesized engine want a real recorded bed under it?

Audition only -- reads shipped .ogg files, writes WAVs to C:\\temp\\fftest,
touches no save data.

NORM'S PROPOSAL (2026-07-20): mix the synthesized engine with a real in-cab
truck sound, maybe the idle. His characterization was that the synth sounded
electronic at first, but that the shipped low/mid/high sound MORE synthesized
on a back-to-back listen.

Measurement says he ranked them correctly. Cycle-to-cycle correlation -- how
much each firing cycle is a literal copy of the one before it, swept over f0
so a wrong period cannot fake a low score:

    idle.ogg   (Duff, real)   r = +0.67
    engine_v1  (synthesized)  r = +0.63
    mid.ogg    (shipped)      r = +0.996

So the synth already varies cycle to cycle about as much as a real recording
does, and the shipped loops are the outlier by a mile -- every cycle is a
near-exact copy, which is the textbook electronic tell. That is what he heard.

BUT IT ALSO MEANS THE SYNTH DOES NOT NEED MORE CYCLE VARIATION. It already
has it. So the "electronic at first" impression is coming from somewhere else,
and there are two candidates this file tests:

1. THE LOOP REPEATS. Cycle-to-cycle variation lives INSIDE the loop, but the
   loop itself is byte-identical every 0.64 s at 1500 rpm. The ear learns a
   0.64 s pattern very quickly, and once learned it stops sounding like an
   engine and starts sounding like a sample. Cycle variation cannot help with
   this -- only loop length or an asynchronous partner can.
2. THERE IS NO CAB AROUND IT. No wind, no HVAC, no chassis rattle, no tire
   roar. A bare engine with nothing else in the room reads as a synth patch
   however good the engine is.

WHY NOT idle.ogg AS THE BED -- the one place I think the proposal bites. The
idle is a RUNNING ENGINE with its own firing frequency. Mixed under a 1500 rpm
synth you get two engines in the cab at once, at unrelated rates, beating
against each other. Rendered below so it can be heard rather than argued.

The bed wants to be the NON-periodic part of the cab: wind, tire, structure.
That is exactly the split Norm already made for gravel vs rumble strip --
synthesize what is timing, sample what is texture -- applied one level up.
`vehicle/road.ogg` is already that slot, already 30 s, and already plays under
the engine, so the architecture exists. It is currently ElevenLabs-generated;
upgrading it to a real in-cab bed is the high-value move.
