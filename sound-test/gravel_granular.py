"""Granular gravel: unlimited, density-controllable shoulder and arrester-bed texture.

Reads licensed source from the local Splice folder; writes auditions to
C:\\temp\\fftest. Never commits audio -- the source stays untracked.

WHY GRANULAR AND NOT A LOOP. Gravel is a stochastic texture: no pitch, no
phrase, no periodicity. Loop five seconds of it and the ear learns the pattern
within about three passes, at which point it stops being gravel and becomes a
sample. Cut the same five seconds into short grains and re-scatter them with
randomised timing, level and playback position, and you get material that
never repeats while sounding identical to the source, because every grain IS
the source.

That also solves the problem a fixed recording cannot: DENSITY BECOMES A
PARAMETER. A car on gravel and a loaded tractor-trailer on gravel are the same
stones being struck at different rates -- eighteen contact patches instead of
four, more weight pressing them in. So one recording drives everything from a
light shoulder scuff to a truck plowing an arrester bed, just by changing
grains per second. No second recording needed, and no pitch-shifting, which
would drag the stone-impact spectrum and make the gravel sound like a
different size of rock.

Same split as the rest of this work: the grains are real recorded stone, the
scheduling is modelled.
