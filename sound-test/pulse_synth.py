"""Audition prototype: pulse-train synthesis for jake brake, rumble strip, tone ladder.

Scratchpad only -- imports nothing from freight_fate, touches no save data,
writes WAVs to its own directory for auditioning in Reaper.

The shared model is source/filter. A phase accumulator walks a spatial or
crankshaft grid and emits one excitation per event; the excitation runs
through a bank of FIXED resonances. Rate moves with speed or RPM, formants
never move -- which is the whole reason this is synthesized rather than a
pitch-shifted sample.

Every frequency and decay below is a starting guess to be tuned by ear
against a real recording. The STRUCTURE is the claim; the numbers are not.

Usage: uv run python pulse_synth.py
