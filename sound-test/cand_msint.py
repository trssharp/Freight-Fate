"""Candidate: MULTISAMPLE REAL INTERIOR.

Pure real cab audio -- no synthesis. Cut steady INTERIOR windows at a ladder of
rpm anchors from the three driver's-seat takes, turn each into a seamless loop,
and build the rev by variable-rate reading the two nearest anchors and
equal-power crossfading them. Each anchor is only ever AUDIBLE when the target
rpm is within ~12% of it (anchors are spaced <=25% apart, so the crossfade
midpoint sits <=sqrt(1.25)-1 ~= 12% of resample), which keeps the fixed
cab/block formants from marching up with rpm -- no micro-engine.

Run from repo root:
