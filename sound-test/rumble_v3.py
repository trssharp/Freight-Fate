"""Audition prototype v3: rumble strip, brighter carrier and an actual body.

Audition only -- imports nothing from freight_fate. Touches no save data.

v2 fixed the excitation model (noise amplitude-modulated at the groove rate,
rather than resonators ringing at a pitch, which built a vowel). It was right
about that. Two things were still wrong, and Norm's ear found both: it sounded
thin, and the transient-heavy variant was clearly better.

1. CARRIER AND MODULATOR OVERLAPPED IN FREQUENCY. v2 put the noise hump at
   115 Hz. The groove rate is 82 Hz at 55 mph and 104 Hz at 70 -- so at
   highway speed the modulator sat ON TOP of the carrier, and above it at 70.
   Amplitude modulation only reads as a crisp buzz when the carrier is well
   above the modulator; when they overlap you get a wobbling hum instead of a
   rasp. The rule of thumb is carrier centroid at least 5-10x the mod rate,
   so at 82 Hz the carrier wants to be centred near 700-1200 Hz, not 115.
   That is also exactly why the transient-heavy variant sounded better: the
   transient layer runs 74 Hz to 1.5 kHz, so turning it up was accidentally
   supplying the high carrier content the main layer lacked.

2. THE MAIN LAYER NEVER PASSED THROUGH THE STRUCTURE. In v2, `body` was raw
   modulated noise -- the only shaping it got was the gentle spectral hump.
   The fixed resonators were applied to the transient layer alone. So the
   layer carrying most of the energy had no axle, no suspension and no tire
   cavity in it. That is the thinness. Here the modulated carrier runs
   through the same fixed body bank, which is what gives it weight without
   giving back the pitch (the resonators ring, they are not gated).

GROOVE SPACING IS NO LONGER A GUESS. FHWA milled shoulder strips are 12 inch
centre-to-centre, 7 inch wide, 0.5 inch deep. 12 in = 0.305 m, so v2's 0.30 m
stands, and the duty cycle is pinned too: 7/12 = 0.58, against the 0.55 that
was being used. Neither number is free to tune by ear any more.

NO SYNTHESIZED GRAVEL. Norm's call, and it is the right one -- the library has
gravel in depth (Sony Vol 5 "Tires On Gravel Steady", General Series 6009
"Auto Road Surfaces"). Synthesis earns its place only where realism lives in
exact TIMING, which is the periodic strip buzz and nothing else. The shoulder
texture is a recording. So this module deliberately produces the strip cue
ALONE, meant to sit on top of a sampled bed rather than to supply its own.
