"""Scan the sound library for a real in-cab diesel to lift FORMANTS from.

Read-only over the NAS library. Writes nothing but a report and short excerpt
WAVs to C:\\temp\\fftest for auditioning.

WHAT THIS IS FOR. Not to find a bed to play back -- to find a recording whose
BLOCK, CAB AND PANEL RESONANCES can become the filter that the synthesized
pulse train runs through. Norm's Pianoteq framing, which is exactly right:
Modartt measured real instruments to get a basis, then exposed the numbers so
you can twiddle them. Same here. The recording supplies the formants; the
synth supplies the timing; the numbers stay tunable.

That makes the selection criteria DIFFERENT from picking a playable loop:

  - Engine-forward, not road-forward. Wind and tire roar are broadband and
    would smear the formant estimate toward noise.
  - Steady. A window with an RPM ramp in it has moving harmonics, and the
    envelope estimator would average them into mush.
  - Low, not hissy. In-cab diesel character lives under ~1 kHz; a hissy take
    means the mic was outside or the transfer path is wrong.
  - A CLEAR firing frequency. If we cannot find the fundamental we cannot
    tell the source from the filter, which is the whole exercise.

Usage: uv run --with numpy --with soundfile python sound-test/engine_donor_scan.py
