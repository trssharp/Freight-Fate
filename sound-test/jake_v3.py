"""Audition prototype v3: the jake at the operating points you actually hear.

Audition only -- imports nothing from freight_fate, touches no save data.
Builds on jake_v2.py in the same directory.

v2 compared the three stages at 1500 rpm, which is a real operating point but
an unusual one -- light braking, low revs, not much happening. Retarding POWER
goes as (active cylinders x RPM), so a jake does its useful work up around
1800-2100 rpm, and drivers downshift specifically to keep the revs there.
That is why the sound everyone knows is high-stage, high-rev, and punctuated
by shifts (Norm, 2026-07-18: "you always hear the jake down shifting").

The shift gaps matter as much as the buzz. A jake cuts out while the clutch is
in and resumes when the gear takes -- at a HIGHER rpm, because a lower gear
spins the engine faster at the same road speed. That interrupted, stair-
stepping pattern is the signature, more than any single steady tone is.

Usage: uv run python jake_v3.py
